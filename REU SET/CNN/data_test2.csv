neutral,@lexia Or even listen to Susan's green policies
neutral,The bad Rabbit would like some carrot.
neutral,This is a man with a gun.
neutral,Miss Moppet looks worse and worse.
neutral,The Mouse comes VERY close.
neutral,I have made many books about well-behaved people.
neutral,He was of a wandering habit and he had foxy whiskers; they never knew where he would be next.
neutral,"They lay in a fluffy bed of rabbit wool and hay, in a shallow burrow, separate from the main rabbit hole."
neutral,To tell the truth--old Mr. Bouncer had forgotten them.
neutral,When Flopsy and Benjamin came back old Mr. Bouncer woke up.
neutral,There was not much difficulty in tracking him; he had left his foot- mark and gone slowly up the winding footpath through the wood.
neutral,"""Yes, yes; not ten minutes since ... he said they were CATERPILLARS; I did think they were kicking rather hard, for caterpillars."""
neutral,"Because Mr. Tod was at home in the stick house he has gone to Mr. Tod's other house, at the top of Bull Banks."
neutral,They crossed several fields and began to climb the hill; the tracks of Tommy Brock were plainly to be seen.
neutral,"Half way up, Cottontail was sitting in her doorway, with four or five half- grown little rabbits playing about her; one black and the others brown."
neutral,It was at the top of a steep bank; the rocks and bushes overhung it.
neutral,"At the other end of the table was a partly unfolded tablecloth, a plate, a tumbler, a knife and fork, salt cellar, mustard and a chair-- in short, preparations for one person's supper."
neutral,The kitchen was empty and silent; the clock had run down.
neutral,They crept up to the bedroom window.
neutral,Nothing could be seen of the young family.
neutral,"They tried to push up a rusty nail between the window sashes; but it was of no use, especially without a light."
neutral,"The moonbeams twinkled on the carving knife and the pie dish, and made a path of brightness across the dirty floor."
neutral,"After much whispering, Peter and Benjamin decided to dig a tunnel."
neutral,They dug and dug for hours.
neutral,Benjamin was on his back scratching upwards.
neutral,He turned the rusty key in the lock; the rabbits below could hear it.
neutral,"When he came back after removing the coal scuttle, Tommy Brock was lying a little more sideways; but he seemed even sounder asleep."
neutral,He stood a minute watching Tommy Brock and listening attentively to the snores.
neutral,The snores continued.
neutral,"He opened the window a little way, and pushed out the greater part of the clothes line on to the window- sill."
neutral,Mr. Tod gingerly mounted a chair by the head of the bedstead.
neutral,So was the counterpane.
neutral,"But, naturally, being a thin- legged person (though vindictive and sandy whiskered)--he was quite unable to lift the heavy weight to the level of the hook and rope."
neutral,"One of Tommy Brock's hind legs twitched under the blanket, but still he slept on peacefully."
neutral,"After considerable thought, he emptied the water into a wash basin and jug."
neutral,As he could not lift the whole pailful of water at once he fetched a milk jug and ladled quarts of water into the pail by degrees.
neutral,"""It will make a great mess in my bedroom; but I could never sleep in that bed again without a spring cleaning of some sort,"" said Mr. Tod."
neutral,He chewed and gnawed for more than twenty minutes.
neutral,Mr. Tod watched it for half an hour; his eyes glistened.
neutral,"Then he cut a caper, and became so bold that he even tapped at the window; but the bundle never moved."
neutral,"Tommy Brock was sitting at Mr. Tod's kitchen table, pouring out tea from Mr. Tod's teapot into Mr. Tod's teacup."
neutral,Everything was upset except the kitchen table.
neutral,"""Be quick, it's all right."
neutral,The day passed heavily.
neutral,"Shall we hide, Cousin Peter?"""
neutral,"They reached home safely, and burst into the rabbit hole."
neutral,A new long pipe and a fresh supply of rabbit tobacco was presented to Mr. Bouncer.
neutral,Then Peter and Benjamin told their story--but they had not waited long enough to be able to tell the end of the battle between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.
neutral,First she scrubbed their faces (this one is Moppet).
neutral,"When the three kittens were ready, Mrs. Tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden, to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast."
neutral,Presently they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses.
neutral,"Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on."
neutral,"And he and Jemima and Rebeccah Puddle-duck set off up the road, keeping step--pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!"
neutral,She sent them upstairs; and I am sorry to say she told her friends that they were in bed with the measles-- which was not true.
neutral,As for the Puddle-ducks--they went into a pond.
neutral,"The clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons."
neutral,"And Mr. Drake Puddle-duck, and Jemima and Rebeccah, have been looking for them ever since."
neutral,"Mrs. Tabitha went up and down all over the house, mewing for Tom Kitten."
neutral,"She went right upstairs and looked into the attics, but she could not find him anywhere."
neutral,They went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before the fire.
neutral,"Where have you looked for him?"""
neutral,Ribby and Tabitha searched and searched.
neutral,"""A rolling pin?"" said Ribby."
neutral,Sure enough the roly-poly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor.
neutral,Tom Kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard.
neutral,"When he saw that his mother was going to bake, he determined to hide."
neutral,"The fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot; but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks."
neutral,So there was plenty of room for a little Tom Cat.
neutral,Tom Kitten coughed and choked with the smoke; he could hear the sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fireplace down below.
neutral,"""This seems funny,"" said Tom Kitten."
neutral,"He groped his way carefully for several yards; he was at the back of the skirting board in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the picture."
neutral,"All at once he fell head over heels in the dark, down a hole, and landed on a heap of very dirty rags."
neutral,". . . his coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with string in very hard knots."
neutral,He made a second journey for the rolling pin.
neutral,"He could hear Ribby and Tabitha talking, but they were too busy lighting the candle to look into the chest."
neutral,Anna Maria went down by way of skirting board and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough.
neutral,She borrowed a small saucer and scooped up the dough with her paws.
neutral,It did not offer to assist him.
neutral,The rats each held an end.
neutral,So it happened that by the time John Joiner had got the plank up-- there was nobody here under the floor except the rolling pin and Tom Kitten in a very dirty dumpling!
neutral,"And when I was going to the post late in the afternoon--I looked up the land from the corner, and I saw Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the run, with big bundles on a little wheelbarrow, which looked very much like mine."
neutral,"She seemed to know her way, and she seemed to have a quantity of luggage."
neutral,"After that, there were no more rats for a long time at Tabitha Twitchit's."
neutral,Once upon a time there was a frog called Mr. Jeremy Fisher; he lived in a little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond.
neutral,The water was all slippy-sloppy in the larder and in the back passage.
neutral,"His rod was a tough stalk of grass, his line was a fine long white horse-hair, and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end."
neutral,There was a bite almost directly; the float gave a tremendous bobbit!
neutral,"And instead of a nice dish of minnows, they had a roasted grasshopper with lady-bird sauce, which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but _I_ think it must have been nasty!"
neutral,One morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the doll's perambulator.
neutral,"A minute afterwards, Hunca Munca, his wife, put her head out, too; and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery, she ventured out on the oilcloth under the coal-box."
neutral,The doll's-house stood at the other side of the fire-place.
neutral,They pushed the front door--it was not fast.
neutral,"The ham broke off the plate with a jerk, and rolled under the table."
neutral,"After pulling half the feathers out of Lucinda's bolster, she remembered that she herself was in want of a feather bed."
neutral,"""Lily-white and clean, oh!"
neutral,"Lucie knocked-once-twice, and interrupted the song."
neutral,"""Oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to Cock Robin!"""
neutral,"Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills."
neutral,"""And what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?"""
neutral,"""Oh that's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny--look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard!"
neutral,"""Now I've finished my ironing; I'm going to air some clothes."""
neutral,"""What are these dear soft fluffy things?"" said Lucie."
neutral,"And here's one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town."
neutral,"They're ALWAYS marked at washing!"" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle."
neutral,She was running running running up the hill--and where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown-and her petticoat?
neutral,Why!
neutral,"They made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water to Owl Island to gather nuts."
neutral,"A little wee man, in a red red coat!"
neutral,"The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening."
neutral,"But next morning they all came back again to Owl Island; and Twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of Old Brown's doorway, and said--"
neutral,"But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old Mr. Brown with a NETTLE and singing--"
neutral,"And you cannot gather a bowl-full!"""
neutral,They paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on Owl Island.
neutral,"On the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in PLUM-PUDDING for Old Brown."
neutral,"Each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dockleaf, fastened with a pine-needle- pin."
neutral,"Which was ridiculous of Nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to Old Brown."
neutral,They had stolen it out of a bumble BEES' nest on the tippity top of the hill.
neutral,But still he did not speak.
neutral,"Nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the WIND, and he took a running jump right onto the head of Old Brown!"
neutral,"She had eight of a family: four little girl pigs, called Cross-patch, Suck-suck, Yock-yock and Spot; and four little boy pigs, called Alexander, Pigling Bland, Chin-Chin and Stumpy."
neutral,"I pinned the papers, for safety, inside their waistcoat pockets; Aunt Pettitoes gave to each a little bundle, and eight conversation peppermints with appropriate moral sentiments in screws of paper."
neutral,Alexander made the road half as long again by skipping from side to side.
neutral,"""But I wish to preserve them for emergencies,"" said Pigling Bland doubtfully."
neutral,"""What's that, young Sirs?"
neutral,Stole a pig?
neutral,"He took a wrong turn--several wrong turns, and was quite lost."
neutral,"Then he dropped in five more dirty, kicking, cackling hens upon the top of Pigling Bland."
neutral,"He pushed the hamper into a corner, threw a sack over it to keep the hens quiet, put a pot on the fire, and unlaced his boots."
neutral,In the course of the day Pigling pushed in all his remaining six peppermints.
neutral,"Mr. Piperson was very affable; he slapped Pigling on the back, made lots of porridge and forgot to lock the meal chest."
neutral,"He went to bed early, and told Pigling upon no account to disturb him next day before twelve o'clock."
neutral,"She pointed at Pigling's plate; he hastily gave it to her, and fled to the meal chest--""How did you come here?"" asked Pigling Bland."
neutral,"""I am sorry."
neutral,"""For somehow they couldn't say--"
neutral,"The sunshine crept down the slopes into the peaceful green valleys, where little white cottages nestled in gardens and orchards."
neutral,"""That's Westmorland,"" said Pig- wig."
neutral,"""I don't want; I want to grow potatoes."""
neutral,"Pig-wig crossed over, they hurried down hill towards the county boundary."
neutral,"""Hallo?"
neutral,"Where are you going to?""--Pigling Bland stared at him vacantly."
neutral,"They ran, and they ran, and they ran down the hill, and across a short cut on level green turf at the bottom, between pebble beds and rushes."
neutral,"Also, there was Mrs. Tittle- mouse's bedroom, where she slept in a little box bed!"
neutral,"Mrs. Tittlemouse was a most terribly tidy particular little mouse, always sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors."
neutral,Sometimes a beetle lost its way in the passages.
neutral,"Another day, a big fat spider came in to shelter from the rain."
neutral,"""Good-day, Babbitty Bumble; I should be glad to buy some bees- wax."
neutral,But what are you doing down here?
neutral,Mrs. Tittlemouse began to pull out the moss.
neutral,"Three or four other bees put their heads out, and buzzed fiercely."
neutral,Buzz!
neutral,"""Bizz, Wizz, Wizzz!"""
neutral,"""How do you do, Mr. Jackson?"
neutral,Mrs. Tittlemouse went round with a mop.
neutral,He opened his mouth most unnecessarily wide; he certainly had not a tooth in his head.
neutral,"Mrs. Tittlemouse followed him with a dishcloth, to wipe his large wet footmarks off the parlor floor."
neutral,"When he had convinced himself that there was no honey in the cupboards, he began to walk down the passage."
neutral,First he squeezed into the pantry.
neutral,There were three creepy-crawly people hiding in the plate rack.
neutral,Then he squeezed into the larder.
neutral,Miss Butterfly was tasting the sugar; but she flew away out of the window.
neutral,Wizz!
neutral,"The name over the window was ""Ginger and Pickles."""
neutral,"They also sold sugar, and snuff and galoshes."
neutral,"In fact, although it was such a small shop it sold nearly everything--except a few things that you want in a hurry--like bootlaces, hair- pins and mutton chops."
neutral,Ginger and Pickles were the people who kept the shop.
neutral,She did not give credit.)
neutral,"Now the meaning of ""credit"" is this--when a customer buys a bar of soap, instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for it --she says she will pay another time."
neutral,But there was always no money; they never paid for as much as a penny- worth of peppermints.
neutral,"""I do not believe that he intends to pay at all,"" replied Ginger."
neutral,"They added up sums and sums, and sums."
neutral,"""Send in all the bills again to everybody `with compliments,'"" replied Ginger."
neutral,"The policeman went on writing in his notebook; twice he put his pencil in his mouth, and once he dipped it in the treacle."
neutral,At length on his last little rush--Pickles found that the shop was empty.
neutral,"They put up the shutters, and left."
neutral,I do not know what occupation he pursues; he looks stout and comfortable.
neutral,The closing of the shop caused great inconvenience.
neutral,Grand cooperative Jumble!
neutral,Penny's penny prices!
neutral,Pussy-cat sits by the fire--how should she be fair?
neutral,"In walks the little dog--says ""Pussy are you there?"
neutral,"Once upon a time there was a Pussy-cat called Ribby, who invited a little dog called Duchess to tea."
neutral,"Ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket, to the village shop to buy a packet of tea, a pound of lump sugar, and a pot of marmalade."
neutral,"They only bowed to one another; they did not speak, because they were going to have a party."
neutral,As soon as Duchess had got round the corner out of sight--she simply ran!
neutral,But there was nobody there.
neutral,"Duchess in the meantime, had slipped out at the back door."
neutral,She sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog.
neutral,"""I think it wants another five minutes,"" said Ribby."
neutral,"She dropped the sugar in confusion, and had to go hunting under the tea- table, so did not see which oven Ribby opened in order to get out the pie."
neutral,Ribby set the pie upon the table; there was a very savoury smell.
neutral,"Duchess came out from under the table-cloth munching sugar, and sat up on a chair."
neutral,"""I will first cut the pie for you; I am going to have muffin and marmalade,"" said Ribby."
neutral,"""Oh, I didn't put one in, my dear Duchess,"" said Ribby; ""I don't think that it is necessary in pies made of mouse."""
neutral,"""It is impossible, my dear Duchess; there was not a patty-pan."""
neutral,Ribby explained that her guest had swallowed a patty-pan.
neutral,"""I am feeling very much better, my dear Ribby,"" said Duchess."
neutral,"""Perhaps it might be wise, my dear Duchess."""
neutral,"The jackdaws were eating piecrust, and the magpie was drinking gravy out of a patty-pan."
neutral,. . .
neutral,The tailor came out of his shop at dark.
neutral,"No one lived there at nights but little brown mice, and THEY ran in and out without any keys!"
neutral,But the tailor came out of his shop and shuffled home through the snow.
neutral,He lived alone with his cat; it was called Simpkin.
neutral,"""Miaw?"" said the cat when the tailor opened the door, ""miaw?"""
neutral,"Then Simpkin again said ""Miaw!"" and took the groat and the pipkin, and went out into the dark."
neutral,"The tailor sat down again by the fire, warming his poor cold hands."
neutral,"Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!"
neutral,"From all the roofs and gables and old wooden houses in Gloucester came a thousand merry voices singing the old Christmas rhymes--all the old songs that ever I heard of, and some that I don't know, like Whittington's bells."
neutral,Under the wooden eaves the starlings and sparrows sang of Christmas pies; the jackdaws woke up in the Cathedral tower; and although it was the middle of the night the throstles and robins sang; and air was quite full of little twittering tunes.
neutral,From the tailor's ship in Westgate came a glow of light; and when Simpkin crept up to peep in at the window it was full of candles.
neutral,"""Four-and-twenty tailors Went to catch a snail, The best man amongst them Durst not touch her tail; She put out her horns Like a little kyloe cow."
neutral,"The sun was shining on the snow when the tailor got up and dressed, and came out into the street with Simpkin running before him."
neutral,But his buttonholes were the greatest triumph of it all.
neutral,"The stitches of those buttonholes were so neat--SO neat--I wonder how they could be stitched by an old man in spectacles, with crooked old fingers, and a tailor's thimble."
neutral,Sometimes Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare.
neutral,"When this happened, the Flopsy Bunnies went across the field to a rubbish heap, in the ditch outside Mr. McGregor's garden."
neutral,Mr. McGregor looked down after emptying his sack.
neutral,He stared at them for some time.
neutral,Presently a fly settled on one of them and it moved.
neutral,Mr. McGregor climbed down on to the rubbish heap--
neutral,The little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them.
neutral,"Mr. McGregor came back and picked up the sack, and carried it off."
neutral,"Mr. McGregor threw down the sack on the stone floor in a way that would have been extremely painful to the Flopsy Bunnies, if they had happened to have been inside it."
neutral,"He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony."
neutral,"That wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all lived Benjamin's aunt and his cousins--Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter."
neutral,"""Peter,"" said little Benjamin, in a whisper, ""who has got your clothes?"""
neutral,Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.
neutral,"They went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood."
neutral,From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's garden.
neutral,It had been sown with lettuces.
neutral,They took them off the scarecrow.
neutral,The lettuces certainly were very fine.
neutral,Perhaps she liked the smell of onions!
neutral,She sat there for FIVE HOURS.
neutral,"He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse, scratching off a handful of fur."
neutral,Then he took out his nephew Peter.
neutral,"Once upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were-- Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter."
neutral,"""Now run along, and don't get into mischief."
neutral,"After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket."
neutral,"And rushed into the toolshed, and jumped into a can."
neutral,"And tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants."
neutral,He went back to his work.
neutral,"Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he has heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny."
neutral,"But presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow, and peeped over."
neutral,His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes.
neutral,"But Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper."
neutral,"When she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance."
neutral,"""Madam, have you lost your way?"" said he."
neutral,"She explained that she had not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nesting place."
neutral,He folded up the newspaper and put it in his coattail pocket.
neutral,"""But as to a nest--there is no difficulty: I have a sackful of feathers in my woodshed."
neutral,"He led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the foxgloves."
neutral,"""This is my summer residence; you would not find my earth--my winter house--so convenient,"" said the hospitable gentleman."
neutral,The gentleman opened the door and showed Jemima in.
neutral,"""Madam, I beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; I will provide oats."
neutral,And she waddled into the kitchen and got two onions out of a basket.
neutral,"Where do you go every afternoon by yourself, Jemima Puddle-duck?"""
neutral,"""Come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs."
neutral,Give me the herbs for the omelet.
neutral,"A moment afterward there were most awful noises--barking, baying, growls and howls, squealing and groans."
neutral,"Once upon a time there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel, called Timmy Tiptoes."
neutral,Now Goody Tiptoes had set to work again by herself.
neutral,"She did not put any more nuts into the woodpecker's hole, because she had always doubted how they could be got out again."
neutral,"What is the explanation of these showers of nuts?"""
neutral,"Bring it about as well as you can, And get you gone, you little old man!"""
neutral,"""Yes, I could,"" said the Chipmunk, ""but my husband, Chippy Hackee, bites!"""
neutral,"And Timmy replied, ""Is that you, Goody Tiptoes?"
neutral,"And so it went on for a fort- night; till a big wind blew off the top of the tree, and opened up the hole and let in the rain."
neutral,But nobody ever answers!
neutral,"ONCE upon a time there was little girl, pretty and dainty."
neutral,"It all looked very lovely, but the old lady could not see very well, and therefore did not get much pleasure out of it."
neutral,"They fitted her, and were bought."
neutral,"The organ pealed forth solemnly, and the sweet children's voices mingled with that of their old leader; but Karen thought only of her red shoes."
neutral,"The sun was shining gloriously, so Karen and the old lady went along the footpath through the corn, where it was rather dusty."
neutral,"It seemed to her as though they were swimming about in the goblet, and she forgot to sing the psalm, forgot to say the ""Lord's Prayer."""
neutral,"Now every one came out of church, and the old lady stepped into her carriage."
neutral,"Suddenly something shone up among the trees, and she believed it was the moon, for it was a face."
neutral,"One morning she danced past a door that she knew well; they were singing a psalm inside, and a coffin was being carried out covered with flowers."
neutral,"She would be industrious, she said, and do everything that she could; she did not mind about the wages as long as she had a roof over her, and was with good people."
neutral,"Then the sun shone so brightly, and right before her stood an angel of God in white robes; it was the same one whom she had seen that night at the church-door."
neutral,"""I am a hen from Kjoge,"" and then she told him how many inhabitants the town contained, and about a battle that had been fought there, which really was not worth speaking of."
neutral,"Then all the kings and queens of Denmark went up the ascent to the old church, hand in hand, with golden crowns on their heads, while the organ played and the fountains sent forth jets of water."
neutral,"And they flew together over Zealand, over green forests and blue lakes."
neutral,"Little Tuk did not at all know what he had dreamt, but One above did."
neutral,"And when one looked at the fields, how beautifully the corn stood and how green it shone, without comparison! and there was a twittering and a fluttering of all the little birds, as if the day were a great festival; and so it was, for it was Sunday."
neutral,"The day was so warm and beautiful that one might well have said: ""God's kindness to us men is beyond all limits."""
neutral,"A pious, faithful soul closed her eyes for ever; she was the pastor's wife. ...""If any one shall find rest in the grave and mercy before our Lord you shall certainly do so,"" said the pastor."
neutral,He folded her hands and read a psalm over the dead woman.
neutral,It was night.
neutral,"""Give me one hair- only one single hair- from the head of the sinner for whom the fire shall never be extinguished, of the sinner whom God will condemn to eternal punishment in hell."""
neutral,"""Yes, one ought to be able to redeem you so easily, you pure, pious woman,"" he said."
neutral,A footman dressed in silk and velvet stood with a large silver-mounted rod near the entrance.
neutral,"Lean as a skeleton, trembling with cold, and hunger, the old man was clinging with all his thoughts to his money."
neutral,They saw him jump up feverishly from his miserable couch and take a loose stone out of the wall; there lay gold coins in an old stocking.
neutral,"I was born with an evil mind, which has brought me hither for the second time; but if I have done wrong I suffer punishment for it."
neutral,"An angel of justice read their crimes and their defence; the latter was not a brilliant one, but it was read before God, Who reads the heart, Who knows everything, the wickedness that comes from within and from without, Who is mercy and love personified."
neutral,"Still, it is very interesting to hear grandfather tell about it."
neutral,"The stick was lifted high in the air, and swung up and down till it jingled again, and quite dazzled one's eyes when the sun shone on all its glory of gold, and silver, and brass."
neutral,"The sun shone; and although they had a little rain too, that was good for the farmer; and when they got wetted thoroughly, they only thought what a blessing it was for the country."
neutral,"The fools played the fool most admirably, and drank mead out of spirit-glasses, which they then flung among the crowd, by whom they were caught up."
neutral,"At the tailor's were pictures of all kinds of clothing, to show that he could stitch up people from the coarsest to the finest; at the tobacco manufacturer's were pictures of the most charming little boys, smoking cigars, just as they do in reality; there were signs with painted butter, and herring, clerical collars, and coffins, and inscriptions and announcements into the bargain."
neutral,"And this is what happened with these shields, when grandpapa came to the town."
neutral,The first night after he came to the town had been signalized by the most terrible gale ever recorded in the newspapers- a gale such as none of the inhabitants had ever before experienced.
neutral,"The air was dark with flying tiles; old wood-work crashed and fell; and a wheelbarrow ran up the streets all alone, only to get out of the way."
neutral,"The water in the canal rose over the banks, for it did not know where to run."
neutral,A shield with a dried salt fish painted on it flew exactly in front of the door of a house where dwelt a man who wrote a newspaper.
neutral,"Perhaps we shall never experience a storm of the kind, but our grandchildren may; and we can only hope and pray that all may stay at home while the storm is moving the shields."
neutral,"And then she told a story that made the feathers on the other hens bristle up, and the cock's comb fall."
neutral,"As she was flying upon the roost, she plucked herself with her beak, and a little feather came out."
neutral,"She had heard and yet not heard, as we are often obliged to do in this world, in order to live at peace; but she could not keep it from her neighbour on the other side any longer."
neutral,Have you heard?
neutral,"""Believe every word of what we tell you,"" said the doves, and cooed down into their poultry-yard."
neutral,"This was not true, for these things belonged to his master; but he was a boaster."
neutral,"I am changing, I am losing all my creases."
neutral,"They had all many things to relate, especially the shirt collar, who was a terrible boaster."
neutral,I had a boot-jack and a brush that I never used.
neutral,"Even my own hair-brush was in love with me, and lost all her hair through neglected love."
neutral,"It happened as a punishment to him, for having boasted so shockingly of things which were not true."
neutral,Nobody had the least idea how it had happened; the weather was quite dry.
neutral,"""But how did the little fellow get his wet feet?"" he then asked."
neutral,"""There, now we know where you got your wet feet,"" said the old man."
neutral,"""Pray, tell me a story."""
neutral,"""What is this woman's name?"" asked the little boy."
neutral,"""'Well, do you remember?' said the old sailor, 'when we were quite small and used to run about and play- it was in the very same yard where we now are- we used to put little branches into the ground and make a garden.'"
neutral,"""'But soon I had to sail about somewhere else, and for many years I was travelling about far away from home.'"
neutral,"Soon afterwards the children and grandchildren came, for they knew very well that it was the golden wedding-day; they had already wished them joy and happiness in the morning, but the old people had forgotten it, although they remembered things so well that had passed many, many years ago."
neutral,"They walked hand in hand out of the bower, and now stood at home in a beautiful flower garden."
neutral,"And they rode round the lawn again, and the little girl, who, as we know, was no other than the little elder-tree mother, continually cried, ""Now we are in the country!"
neutral,"They walked about hand in hand, just as the old couple had done when they were little, but they did not go to the round tower nor to the Fredericksburg garden."
neutral,"And during their whole flight the elder-tree smelt so sweetly; he noticed the roses and the fresh beeches, but the elder-tree smelt much stronger, for the flowers were fixed on the little girl's bosom, against which the boy often rested his head during the flight."
neutral,"""It is beautiful here in spring,"" said the little girl, and they were again in the green beechwood, where the thyme breathed forth sweet fragrance at their feet, and the pink anemones looked lovely in the green moss."
neutral,"The high walls and indented battlements were reflected in the water of the ditches, on which swans were swimming and peering into the old shady avenues."
neutral,"""Here it is beautiful in autumn!"" said the little girl, and the atmosphere seemed twice as high and blue, while the wood shone with crimson, green, and gold."
neutral,"He distinctly saw the little girl, with her bright blue eyes, peeping out from behind the petals, and heard her whispering, ""Here it is beautiful in spring, in summer, in autumn, and in winter,"" and hundreds of pictures passed through his mind."
neutral,"There they both sat like a king and queen under the sweet-smelling tree, which looked exactly like an elder-tree, and he told his wife the story of the elder-tree mother as it had been told him when he was a little boy."
neutral,"And the old man opened his prayer-book; the elder-blossom was still in it, and as fresh as if it had only just been put in."
neutral,"And she covered him up well, so that he might not take cold."
neutral,In one of its wings (the larger one) there is still a church.
neutral,"They can be heard in the rushing of the storm, and their singing brings up strange thoughts in the hearers- thoughts of the old times into which we are carried back."
neutral,"The stranded goods belong to the bishop, and there is a store of goods here."
neutral,The Bishop of Borglum is a mighty lord.
neutral,Her son was not at home.
neutral,For years there had been no news of him.
neutral,"What writest thou on yonder smooth parchment, sealing it with thy seal, and intrusting it to the horsemen and servants, who ride away, far away, to the city of the Pope?"
neutral,"They came from Rome with a papal decree- a ban, or bull, against the widow who had dared to offend the pious bishop."
neutral,"And there met them a stalwart knight, with a train of twelve armed followers."
neutral,"Jens Glob laid a complaint against the bishop, and summoned him before the temporal and the spiritual court."
neutral,Again it is the time of falling leaves and stranded ships.
neutral,"Blow thy brazen trumpet, thou trumpeter clad in fox-skin! it sounds merrily in the clear air."
neutral,The lights burn clear in the heavy brass candelabra.
neutral,"The storm reads out the accusation and the sentence, roaming in the air over moor and heath, and over the rolling waters."
neutral,He intends to risk his life alone in the roaring waters; but they are to bear witness for him that it is not his fault if Jens Glob stands without reinforcement in the church at Widberg.
neutral,"The faithful warriors will not leave him, but follow him out into the deep waters."
neutral,It is past midnight.
neutral,It is Christmas.
neutral,"And the sword leaps from the scabbard, and Olaf Hase deals a blow that makes the panel of the church door, which Jens Glob hastily closes between them, fly in fragments."
neutral,"It is heard in the dark night by the frightened husbandman, driving by in the heavy sandy road past the convent of Borglum."
neutral,It is heard by the sleepless listener in the thickly-walled rooms at Borglum.
neutral,"A storm approaches without, calling aloud for human lives."
neutral,The new time flings sunshine into the room.
neutral,And here is a nettle: what may its leaves tell us?
neutral,"After some time, the linen was taken into the house, placed under the scissors, and cut and torn into pieces, and then pricked with needles."
neutral,"This certainly was not pleasant; but at last it was made into twelve garments of that kind which people do not like to name, and yet everybody should wear one."
neutral,"I am now divided into twelve pieces, and yet we are all one and the same in the whole dozen."
neutral,"And at length they fell into rags and tatters, and thought it was all over with them, for they were torn to shreds, and steeped in water, and made into a pulp, and dried, and they knew not what besides, till all at once they found themselves beautiful white paper."
neutral,"I suppose now I shall be sent on my travels about the world, so that people may read me."
neutral,No doubt I shall still go forward.
neutral,"The children in the house stood round the stove; for they wanted to see the paper burn, because it flamed up so prettily, and afterwards, among the ashes, so many red sparks could be seen running one after the other, here and there, as quick as the wind."
neutral,"The whole bundle of paper had been placed on the fire, and was soon alight."
neutral,"Lovers pluck off the leaves, and as they pluck each leaf, they ask a question about their lovers; thus: ""Does he or she love me?- Ardently?"
neutral,Very much?
neutral,"""Darling Marguerite daisy,"" he said to her, ""you are the wisest woman of all the flowers."
neutral,"""That is my sister,"" replied the pea-blossom."
neutral,"For the heart asks for fragrance, even when it is no longer young; and there is very little of that to be found in the dahlias or the dry chrysanthemums; therefore the butterfly turned to the mint on the ground."
neutral,And the butterfly became what is called an old bachelor.
neutral,"It was late in the autumn, with rainy and cloudy weather."
neutral,"The cold wind blew over the bowed backs of the willows, so that they creaked again."
neutral,"He was young at that time- indeed, he is young still, although he is ten years older than he was then."
neutral,"""That is not what I asked,"" persisted the widow; ""I mean, has he a wife and children?"""
neutral,"The house of the naval officer's widow was the one most constantly visited by Mr. Alfred, the sculptor."
neutral,"She was really beautiful; but some said she was rather dull, and slept late of a morning."
neutral,"""She has been accustomed to that,"" her mother said."
neutral,"""So that is a burning mountain; but is it not very dangerous to the people who live near it?"""
neutral,"""No; I did not see any of the eruptions which are represented in those pictures; but I will show you a sketch of my own, which represents an eruption I once saw."""
neutral,She said it seemed like connecting herself with Thorwalsden.
neutral,"""It is really necessary that I should mould the clay myself,"" he replied."
neutral,"Then he unfolded to them both the beauties of Nature, in all her works; he pointed out to them how, in the scale of creation, inanimate matter was inferior to animate nature; the plant above the mineral, the animal above the plant, and man above them all."
neutral,"""Ah, that is some of your mythologies,"" said mamma-in-law."
neutral,"There they sat, all three; and as for Alfred, a proverb may describe his position- he looked like a swan amongst the geese."
neutral,"The magic of form had enchanted him; he had looked at the casket without caring to inquire what it contained, and that omission often brings the greatest unhappiness into married life."
neutral,"The young married pair often sat together hand in hand; he would talk, but she could only now and then let fall a word in the same melodious voice, the same bell-like tones."
neutral,"It was a mental relief when Sophy, one of her friends, came to pay them a visit."
neutral,"The journey had also tired Kaela; but she was always fatigued, that was the worst of it."
neutral,The chief thing still remains.
neutral,This spirit sleeps through the day while the sun shines down upon the water; but in starry and moonlit nights he shows himself.
neutral,He is very old.
neutral,"Once the Bell hung in the church tower; but now there is no trace left of the tower or of the church, which was called St. Alban's."
neutral,"He was young and handsome, but thoughtful exceedingly."
neutral,"He sat down close under me, and played with two little sticks as if they had been a stringed instrument; and he sang to it."
neutral,"'Now I may sing it out aloud, though at other times I may not whisper it."
neutral,"The crows, ravens and magpies started up in terror at the yelling and shouting that sounded around."
neutral,"They flew into the tower and out again, they looked down upon the throng below, and they also looked into the windows of the church, and screamed out aloud what they saw there."
neutral,The air knows everything.
neutral,"Day and night she had attended to the sick child, nursing and carrying it in her bosom, as a part of herself."
neutral,"She could not realize the fact that the child was dead, and must be laid in a coffin to rest in the ground."
neutral,"She tried to believe that man was but dust, and that with his life all existence ended."
neutral,"For nights previously the mother had not slept, but in the morning twilight of this day she sunk from weariness into a deep sleep; in the mean time the coffin was carried into a distant room, and there nailed down, that she might not hear the blows of the hammer."
neutral,"They at last persuaded her to lie down, and then she would lie as still as if she slept."
neutral,"He folded his arms and prayed, and soon sunk himself into healthful sleep; therefore he did not notice that his wife arose, threw on her clothes, and glided silently from the house, to go where her thoughts constantly lingered- to the grave of her child."
neutral,"It was a lovely starlight night in the beginning of September, and the air was mild and still."
neutral,"""Thou wouldst gladly go down and be with thy child,"" said a voice quite close to her,- a voice that sounded so deep and clear, that it went to her heart."
neutral,"She looked up, and by her side stood a man wrapped in a black cloak, with a hood closely drawn over his face; but her keen glance could distinguish the face under the hood."
neutral,"""Darest thou to follow me?"" asked the form."
neutral,May I not fly away?
neutral,Then she kissed and fondled her child.
neutral,Suddenly her name was called from above; what could it mean? her name uttered in a plaintive voice.
neutral,"""Hearest thou?"" said the child."
neutral,"""It is my father who calls thee."""
neutral,"""Mother, now the bells of heaven are ringing,"" said the child; ""mother, the sun is going to rise."""
neutral,"All around her became cold; she lifted her head, and saw that she was lying in the churchyard, on the grave of her child."
neutral,"She bowed her knees, and prayed for forgiveness."
neutral,"Ostentation, pride, splendor, and display ruled, but not the fear of the Lord."
neutral,"At length I lay down to rest on the shores of Zeeland, near to the great house of Borreby, where the splendid forest of oaks still flourished."
neutral,"'The loftiest tree may be bowed without being broken,' said a voice within him."
neutral,"""I passed on in my course,"" said the Wind, ""and he passed away also."
neutral,"He was not allowed to remain, and little Ida got over it, because she was obliged to do so."
neutral,"I heard it all,"" said the Wind, ""for I accompanied the gentlemen through the open door of the stable, and strewed stalks of straw, like bars of gold, at their feet."
neutral,"Then they croaked in harsh accents of the forest that now existed no more, of the many pretty birds' nests destroyed and the little ones left without a home; and all for the sake of that great bit of lumber, that proud ship, that never sailed forth."
neutral,"I let it hear my voice, that it might know what the storm has to say."
neutral,Certainly I did my part towards teaching it seamanship.
neutral,"The gentlemen appeared clad in steel, or in rich cloaks lined with squirrel's fur; they wore little ruffs, and swords at their sides."
neutral,"Where would Joanna's place be on that wall some day? and how would he look,- her noble lord and husband?"
neutral,"He would lock himself in his room, and for days the fire would be kept burning; but he did not talk much of what he was doing."
neutral,So he fondly hoped; therefore the chimney smoked and the fire crackled so constantly.
neutral,"The splendid black horses, where are they?"
neutral,"What became of the cows in the field, the old gold and silver vessels in cupboards and chests, and even the house and home itself?"
neutral,"I twirled the weather-cock round on the summit of the tower, and it creaked like the snoring of a warder, but no warder was there; nothing but mice and rats."
neutral,"'After winter, spring will come,' he said, 'after want, good times."
neutral,"""It was the morning of Easter-day."
neutral,"The bells sounded from the neighboring church, and the sun seemed to rejoice in the sky."
neutral,"There was another kind of sweeping taking place at Waldemar Daa's, in the castle of Borreby."
neutral,"Then I rushed against the house and the old lime-trees with such force, that one of the thickest branches, a decayed one, was broken off, and the branch fell at the entrance, and remained there."
neutral,"Yes, there was one thing more, an alchymist's glass, a new one, which had been lately bought, and filled with what could be gathered from the ground of the treasure which had promised so much but failed in keeping its promise."
neutral,Why?
neutral,"""The eldest and youngest, hand-in-hand, Went forth alone to a distant land."""
neutral,What were they looking at?
neutral,She remembered that time well; for it was Anna Dorothea.
neutral,The poor school-boys did not even sing a psalm when the former lord of Borreby was laid in the earth to rest.
neutral,"I took pity on the proudest of the sisters,"" said the Wind."
neutral,"On such another Easter morning as that on which Waldemar Daa imagined he had discovered the art of making gold, I heard the tones of a psalm under the stork's nest, and within the crumbling walls."
neutral,"They are the image of their father, who is so unkind, he never comes to see."""
neutral,"I was persuaded to hatch some once, and after all my care and trouble with the young ones, they were afraid of the water."
neutral,"You must bow your heads prettily to that old duck yonder; she is the highest born of them all, and has Spanish blood, therefore, she is well off."
neutral,"I think he will grow up pretty, and perhaps be smaller; he has remained too long in the egg, and therefore his figure is not properly formed;"" and then she stroked his neck and smoothed the feathers, saying, ""It is a drake, and therefore not of so much consequence."
neutral,"The ducks pecked him, the chickens beat him, and the girl who fed the poultry kicked him with her feet."
neutral,"Not far from here is another moor, in which there are some pretty wild geese, all unmarried."
neutral,"""Pop, pop,"" echoed far and wide in the distance, and whole flocks of wild geese rose up from the rushes."
neutral,"The blue smoke from the guns rose like clouds over the dark trees, and as it floated away across the water, a number of sporting dogs bounded in among the rushes, which bent beneath them wherever they went."
neutral,"He turned away his head to hide it under his wing, and at the same moment a large terrible dog passed quite near him."
neutral,"His jaws were open, his tongue hung from his mouth, and his eyes glared fearfully."
neutral,"And so he lay quite still, while the shot rattled through the rushes, and gun after gun was fired over him."
neutral,"There was therefore a narrow opening near the bottom large enough for him to slip through, which he did very quietly, and got a shelter for the night."
neutral,"A woman, a tom cat, and a hen lived in this cottage."
neutral,"The tom cat, whom the mistress called, ""My little son,"" was a great favorite; he could raise his back, and purr, and could even throw out sparks from his fur if it were stroked the wrong way."
neutral,"In the morning, the strange visitor was discovered, and the tom cat began to purr, and the hen to cluck."
neutral,"""What is that noise about?"" said the old woman, looking round the room, but her sight was not very good; therefore, when she saw the duckling she thought it must be a fat duck, that had strayed from home."
neutral,"""No."""
neutral,"""You don't understand me,"" said the duckling."
neutral,"I advise you, therefore, to lay eggs, and learn to purr as quickly as possible."""
neutral,"The clouds, heavy with hail and snow-flakes, hung low in the sky, and the raven stood on the ferns crying, ""Croak, croak."""
neutral,"He was not envious of these beautiful creatures, but wished to be as lovely as they."
neutral,"Poor ugly creature, how gladly he would have lived even with the ducks had they only given him encouragement."
neutral,"He had been persecuted and despised for his ugliness, and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the birds."
neutral,"The first part might be left out, but it gives us a few particulars, and these are useful We were staying in the country at a gentleman's seat, where it happened that the master was absent for a few days."
neutral,His outward appearance was characterized by a snub nose and a very fat back.
neutral,"The child said not a word, nor did she cry; but each time the little door was opened she gave a long, long look into the yard."
neutral,"That is the story, and whoever does not understand it may go and purchase a share in the tan-yard from the window."
neutral,"Though the water was clear, the sun never looked down far enough into the well to mirror itself in the waters; but as far as its beams could reach, green things grew forth between the stones in the sides of the well."
neutral,"She certainly had not much to tell of the things up above, but she knew this, and all the Frogs knew it, that the well was not all the world."
neutral,"As I have come so far, I must try to go still farther."""
neutral,"She came to the ditch; and forget-me-nots were growing there, and meadow-sweet; and a very little way off was a hedge of whitethorn, and elder bushes grew there, too, and bindweed with white flowers."
neutral,"Gay colors were to be seen here, and a butterfly, too, was flitting by."
neutral,"On the ninth day she thought, ""Forward! onward!"""
neutral,"During the last night there had been a sound borne on the breeze, as if there were cousins in the neighborhood."
neutral,And so she went forward on her journey.
neutral,"She came out into the open field, to a great pond, round about which grew reeds; and she walked into it."
neutral,"I must look out, that I may not miss the opportunity."
neutral,And some fowls came.
neutral,Now I smell cabbage; now I am near my leaf.
neutral,"But I must go higher up."""
neutral,In the farm-house lived two young students; the one was a poet and the other a scientific searcher into the secrets of nature.
neutral,"""Yes, if we could find the jewel in its head,"" said the poet, ""I too should be for cutting it open.'"
neutral,"The two friends walked on, and thus she escaped the fate of being bottled up in spirits."
neutral,"Father-Stork was making a speech to his family, and his family was glancing down at the two young men in the kitchen garden."
neutral,"Why, it changes in every day's journey we make."
neutral,They rush along by means of an invention they call 'railway;' but they often break their necks over it.
neutral,"We could do without them very well, so long as we only keep frogs and earth-worms."""
neutral,Whither?
neutral,"Think! the Caterpillar is changed, and turns into a beautiful butterfly; the Stork family flies over mountains and seas, to the distant Africa, and yet finds the shortest way home to the same country- to the same roof."
neutral,But the jewel in the head of the toad?
neutral,"A DUCK once arrived from Portugal, but there were some who said she came from Spain, which is almost the same thing."
neutral,"""She's quite full of 'Portulak,'"" said a little common duck, who was witty."
neutral,Then the other ducks began to notice the little bird.
neutral,"""For our part we don't care to fill our beaks with such long words, but we sympathize with you quite as much."
neutral,"There are two Cochin Chinese amongst them; they wear feathers on their legs, and are well educated."
neutral,"Then the fowls arrived, and the cock was polite enough to-day to keep from being rude."
neutral,"His feathers had been much ruffled by his bath, so that he seemed to them quite like a tiny Chinese fowl."
neutral,"But the fowls of the neighborhood were all awake, and, to tell the truth, they had paid a visit to the duckyard, simply and solely to find food for themselves."
neutral,"I've taken your part, and now I'll teach you better manners."""
neutral,"""There's not much of him lying there,"" observed the cock."
neutral,"The sun went down, and the full moon rose, large, round, and clear, shining in the deep blue."
neutral,"""There it comes again, from the other side,"" said the Snow Man, who supposed the sun was showing himself once more."
neutral,"He was quite hoarse, and could not pronounce ""Bow wow"" properly."
neutral,"It will come again to-morrow, and most likely teach you to run down into the ditch by the well; for I think the weather is going to change."
neutral,"""Of course I know them,"" replied the yard-dog; ""she has stroked my back many times, and he has given me a bone of meat."
neutral,"I never bite those two."""
neutral,"I had my own cushion, and there was a stove- it is the finest thing in the world at this season of the year."
neutral,"He was looking into the housekeeper's room on the lower storey; where the stove stood on its four iron legs, looking about the same size as the Snow Man himself."
neutral,"""But it's all over now."
neutral,"She sang,- ""On the summit of mount Olympus, in a forest of dwarf firs, lay an old stag."
neutral,"I knew he would bring me some shells from the gulf of Lepanto, or perhaps a knife with a shining blade."
neutral,"She was wrapped in a fur; but when this was taken off, and she lay in my mother's lap, three silver coins were found fastened in her dark hair; they were all her possessions."
neutral,"It was a deep wound, and the thick sheep-skin cloak was stiff with congealed blood."
neutral,How pretty and bright she looked: even my mother's eyes were not more gentle than hers.
neutral,"They had sworn brotherhood in their youth, and the most beautiful and virtuous maiden in the neighborhood was chosen to perform the act of consecration upon this bond of friendship."
neutral,They only stayed a short time.
neutral,"How long we were kept in prison, I do not know; but many days and nights passed by."
neutral,In the centre of the floor stood a coffin filled with roses.
neutral,"Each one carried a burning taper in his hand, and one was given to me, as well as to little Anastasia."
neutral,And thus it was that for the first time I met Aphtanides.
neutral,"I lay on my back in the boat, Anastasia leaned against me, while the stars above us glittered more brightly than the lamps in our church."
neutral,"At about two miles from our cottage, where the earth on the hill is sheltered by a few scattered trees, stood the little church, with a silver lamp hanging before the altar."
neutral,"I put on my best clothes, and the white tunic fell in graceful folds over my hips."
neutral,"When we entered the little, unpretending church, the evening sunlight streamed through the open door on the burning lamp, and glittered on the golden picture frames."
neutral,"And we again answered, ""Yes."""
neutral,"Then a song was sung by other holy men behind the altar-screen, and the bond of eternal friendship was confirmed."
neutral,How cheerful everything seemed now in our little cottage by the Delphian springs!
neutral,"We spoke of the sorrows of Greece, and of the men of the country who could be trusted."
neutral,"Presently I seized his hand: ""Aphtanides,"" I exclaimed, ""there is one thing still that you must know,- one thing that till now has been a secret between myself and Heaven."
neutral,"""And whom do you love?"" asked Aphtanides."
neutral,"Brother, think of this; I have seen her daily, she has grown up beside me, and has become a part of my soul."""
neutral,We wandered silently homeward across the mountains.
neutral,"FROM my father I received the best inheritance, namely a ""good temper."""
neutral,"""And pray what was his profession and his standing in respectable society?"""
neutral,"And yet my father was not a skin-dresser nor an executioner; on the contrary, his employment placed him at the head of the grandest people of the town, and it was his place by right."
neutral,"There, now, the truth is out."
neutral,"Every one can read the newspaper for himself, but come with me to the churchyard while the sun shines and the trees are green, and let us wander among the graves."
neutral,"He walked about in a coat embroidered all over, and in the drawing-rooms of society looked just like one of those rich pearl-embroidered bell-pulls, which are only made for show; and behind them always hangs a good thick cord for use."
neutral,"Now I can imagine that this same idea may prevent him from resting quietly in his grave; for suppose that to produce a good effect, it is necessary to bring out his new idea at breakfast, and that he can only make his appearance on earth at midnight, as ghosts are believed generally to do; why then this good idea would not suit the hour, and the man would have to carry it down again with him into the grave- that must be a troubled grave."
neutral,"And it is well known that if the yard-cock belonging to this family happened to crow at midnight, they would declare it was morning, although the watchman and all the clocks in the town were proclaiming the hour of twelve at night."
neutral,"He examined and tested the plant, but it did not belong to his system of botany, nor could he possibly find out to what class it did belong."
neutral,"The large trees which grew round it saw the plant and heard the remarks, but they said not a word either good or bad, which is the wisest plan for those who are ignorant."
neutral,"There passed through the forest a poor innocent girl; her heart was pure, and her understanding increased by her faith."
neutral,Then came the swineherd; he was collecting thistles and shrubs to burn them for the ashes.
neutral,"""This will be as useful as any,"" he said; so the plant was carried away."
neutral,"There was one, but it lay in the coffin of the dead; no one knew anything about it."
neutral,And this part is really the most pleasant part of the story.
neutral,"The story I am going to tell you happened a great many years ago, so it is well to hear it now before it is forgotten."
neutral,I have never heard of it.
neutral,"The nobleman went up stairs and down, through halls and passages; yet none of those whom he met had heard of the bird."
neutral,"""But the book in which I have read this account,"" said the emperor, ""was sent to me by the great and mighty emperor of Japan, and therefore it cannot contain a falsehood."
neutral,"Every evening I have permission to take home to my poor sick mother the scraps from the table; she lives down by the sea-shore, and as I come back I feel tired, and I sit down in the wood to rest, and listen to the nightingale's song."
neutral,"As they went along, a cow began lowing."
neutral,"""Now I hear it, tinkling like little church bells."""
neutral,"""Shall I sing once more before the emperor?"" asked the nightingale, who thought he was present."
neutral,The walls and floors of porcelain glittered in the light of a thousand lamps.
neutral,"The whole court was present, and the little kitchen-maid had received permission to stand by the door."
neutral,"Eleven peddlers' children were named after her, but not of them could sing a note."
neutral,"But instead of a book, it was a work of art contained in a casket, an artificial nightingale made to look like a living one, and covered all over with diamonds, rubies, and sapphires."
neutral,"As soon as the artificial bird was wound up, it could sing like the real one, and could move its tail up and down, which sparkled with silver and gold."
neutral,"The street-boys sang, ""Zi-zi-zi, cluck, cluck, cluck,"" and the emperor himself could sing it also."
neutral,"All around the bed and peeping through the long velvet curtains, were a number of strange heads, some very ugly, and others lovely and gentle-looking."
neutral,"""Do you remember this?"""
neutral,"""Then will you give me the beautiful golden sword and that rich banner? and will you give me the emperor's crown?"" said the bird."
neutral,"Then Death longed to go and see his garden, and floated out through the window in the form of a cold, white mist."
neutral,"""No; do not do that,"" replied the nightingale; ""the bird did very well as long as it could."
neutral,"""Everything,"" said the emperor, who, having dressed himself in his imperial robes, stood with the hand that held the heavy golden sword pressed to his heart."
neutral,"""I only ask one thing,"" she replied; ""let no one know that you have a little bird who tells you everything."
neutral,"It will be best to conceal it."""
neutral,"But there they are, and it is no delusion."
neutral,It looked like a whole town of naked wild men.
neutral,"IT was bitterly cold, the sky glittered with stars, and not a breeze stirred."
neutral,"""Bump""- an old pot was thrown at a neighbor's door; and ""bang, bang,"" went the guns; for they were greeting the New Year."
neutral,"The wish passed round, and the glasses clashed together till they rang again; while before the town-gate the mail coach stopped with the twelve strange passengers."
neutral,"""See for yourself in the passport,"" he replied."
neutral,"I throw shillings and pence among the people; I give balls, no less than thirty-one; indeed, that is the highest number I can spare for balls."
neutral,Then the second alighted.
neutral,His luggage consisted of a great cask.
neutral,"""MARCH, March,"" the fourth called after him, slapping him on the shoulder, ""don't you smell something?"
neutral,I can smell it out here already.
neutral,"Forward, Master March."""
neutral,Here I am.
neutral,"On Sundays I go out walking in shoes and white silk stockings, and a muff."""
neutral,"But she was not without a protector; her younger brother, JULY, was with her."
neutral,"The forest, on his arrival, had to change its colors when he wished it; and how beautiful are the colors he chooses!"
neutral,The woods glow with hues of red and gold and brown.
neutral,This great master painter could whistle like a blackbird.
neutral,"Squire OCTOBER brought his dog and his gun with him, and had nuts in his game bag."
neutral,"Then the little figures on the tree will become lively, and the little waxen angel at the top spread out his wings of gold-leaf, and fly down from his green perch."
neutral,"Let the horses be put up."""
neutral,"He had shaved his chin uncommonly smooth, although he had cut himself slightly, and had stuck a piece of newspaper over the place."
neutral,"How much have you got in it?"""
neutral,"""No, it was yesterday,"" replied the boy."
neutral,"It is cold in the water, and I have stood here six hours."
neutral,"""You really do need something to give you a little warmth, and yet spiteful people cry out about the few drops you take."""
neutral,"""Yes,"" said Martha; ""I remember you were in service there, and lived in the house when the mayor's parents were alive; how many years ago that is."
neutral,"Kind Martha warmed a mug of beer for her, with butter and sugar- she considered this the best medicine- and then hastened to the river, washed and rinsed, badly enough, to be sure, but she did her best."
neutral,"The student was merry and gay, brave and affectionate; every drop of blood in him was good and honorable; a better man never lived on earth."
neutral,You have not been educated like he has.
neutral,"He is a widower, without children, and in a good position."
neutral,Will you think it over?'
neutral,It seemed like a providence that as I stepped out of church Eric came towards me; and then there remained not a doubt in my mind.
neutral,"At Michaelmas we were married, and for the first year everything went well with us."
neutral,The student I never met again.
neutral,"""We had five hundred dollars,"" she said, ""and there was a house in the street to be sold for two hundred, so we thought it would be worth our while to pull it down and build a new one in its place; so it was bought."
neutral,"I have scrubbed and washed both coarse and fine linen, but I have not been able to make myself better off; and it was God's will."
neutral,"In the meantime a messenger had been sent to her house by the mayor, to say that she must come to him immediately, as he had something to tell her."
neutral,"Martha strewed sand on the grave and planted a rose-tree upon it, and the boy stood by her side."
neutral,I am sure the pretty bird will fly down and call upon them.
neutral,No one has the least idea.
neutral,"Then two little boys came out of the garden; one of them had a large sharp knife, like that with which the girl had cut the tulips."
neutral,"""No let it stay,"" said the other boy, ""it looks so pretty""."
neutral,"You and the piece of grass are all they have given me in exchange for the whole world, which I enjoyed outside."
neutral,"""I wish I could console the poor lark,"" thought the daisy."
neutral,The bird's body was placed in a pretty red box; they wished to bury it with royal honours.
neutral,"THERE was once a regular student, who lived in a garret, and had no possessions."
neutral,"Whatever object in the room he placed his tongue upon immediately received voice and speech, and was able to express its thoughts and feelings as readily as the lady herself could do."
neutral,"It could only be used by one object at a time, which was a good thing, as a number speaking at once would have caused great confusion."
neutral,"The goblin laid the tongue upon the cask, in which lay a quantity of old newspapers."
neutral,"The fruit gleamed like stars, and the room was filled with sounds of beautiful music."
neutral,"He stood still on tiptoe, peeping in, till the light went out in the garret."
neutral,"But from that time forward, the whole shop, from the cash box down to the pinewood logs, formed their opinions from that of the cask; and they all had such confidence in him, and treated him with so much respect, that when the huckster read the criticisms on theatricals and art of an evening, they fancied it must all come from the cask."
neutral,"Was it in their house, or a neighbor's?"
neutral,Each wished to keep the best things they had.
neutral,"""May I be allowed to ask if you are made of gold?"" she inquired of her neighbor, a pin; ""you have a very pretty appearance, and a curious head, although you are rather small."
neutral,There's a straw going by now; how he turns and twists about!
neutral,One day something lying close to the darning-needle glittered so splendidly that she thought it was a diamond; yet it was only a piece of broken bottle.
neutral,It seems as if the sunbeams were always looking for me under the water.
neutral,"""Here comes an egg-shell sailing along,"" said one of the boys; so they stuck the darning-needle into the egg-shell."
neutral,"She was not sea-sick, and she did not break."
neutral,"""It is a good thing against sea-sickness to have a steel stomach, and not to forget one's own importance."
neutral,"Crack went the egg-shell, as a waggon passed over it."
neutral,"Verses too were written over the windows in old-fashioned letters, and grotesque faces, curiously carved, grinned at you from under the cornices."
neutral,"The rain was intended to pour out at the dragon's mouth, but it ran out of his body instead, for there was a hole in the gutter."
neutral,"It is really too ridiculous."""
neutral,"How the street must have looked when the houses had all gable roofs, open staircases, and gutters with dragons at the spout."
neutral,He could even see soldiers walking about with halberds.
neutral,"An old man lived in it, who wore knee-breeches, a coat with large brass buttons, and a wig, which any one could see was a real wig."
neutral,Afterwards he was sent over to ask the little boy if he would not like to pay a visit himself.
neutral,Then the door opened.
neutral,"In the balcony stood flower-pots, on which were heads having asses' ears, but the flowers in them grew just as they pleased."
neutral,I shall certainly have the gout like the old cupboard.
neutral,"On the wall near the centre of the room hung the picture of a beautiful lady, young and gay, dressed in the fashion of the olden times, with powdered hair, and a full, stiff skirt."
neutral,"But I knew this lady many years ago, and she has been dead nearly half a century."""
neutral,"Then he took from the book-case, a book full of pictures representing long processions of wonderful coaches, such as are never seen at the present time."
neutral,"Do you think he ever has friendly looks, or a Christmas tree?"
neutral,"It was Sunday morning, and you children stood round the table, singing the hymn that you sing every morning."
neutral,"So all this, and everything else that I have seen, keeps running in my head, and these must be the old recollections that bring so many thoughts with them."
neutral,"Then the old man came in, with a box containing many curious things to show him."
neutral,"Rouge-pots, scent-boxes, and old cards, so large and so richly gilded, that none are ever seen like them in these days."
neutral,The boards of the floor were open and full of holes.
neutral,"The tin soldier had fallen through a crack between the boards, and lay there now in an open grave."
neutral,"Some were taken one way, some another."
neutral,"""It is very likely that this is really the same soldier,"" said she, and I will take care of him, and always remember what you have told me; but some day you must show me the old man's grave."""
neutral,But the tin soldier did not believe any such thing.
neutral,"Her own boy was provided for by being at the laborer's where the mouth watered more frequently than the pot boiled, and where in general no one was at home to take care of the child."
neutral,"He had food, and he could also do something towards earning his living; he took care of Mary's red cow, for he knew how to tend cattle and make himself useful."
neutral,"Anne Lisbeth's boy also sat in the sunshine on the top of the fence, cutting out a little toy."
neutral,"If it was spring-time, he knew of three strawberry-plants in blossom, which would certainly bear fruit."
neutral,"He went to sea in a wretched vessel, and sat at the helm, while the skipper sat over the grog-can."
neutral,"It was perfect in the upper part, but the foot was broken off, and it had therefore been fixed upon a little carved block of wood, painted blue."
neutral,"The wind cut through the rigging, and the boat cut through the sea."
neutral,What has struck the boat?
neutral,"Was it a waterspout, or a heavy sea rolling suddenly upon them?"
neutral,"There might have been mice on board, but only one man and a half, the skipper and the laborer's boy."
neutral,"No one saw it but the skimming sea-gulls and the fishes beneath the water; and even they did not see it properly, for they darted back with terror as the boat filled with water and sank."
neutral,"Anne Lisbeth had now lived in the town many years; she was called ""Madame,"" and felt dignified in consequence; she remembered the old, noble days, in which she had driven in the carriage, and had associated with countess and baroness."
neutral,She had not seen him since she carried him in her arms; neither had she been for years to the count's palace; it was quite a journey thither from the town.
neutral,"""I must make one effort to go,"" said Anne Lisbeth, ""to see my darling, the count's sweet child, and press him to my heart."
neutral,"She drove across the country in a grazier's cart, and then got out, and continued her journey on foot, and thus reached the count's castle."
neutral,"He who filled her every thought! he whom she loved best, and who was her whole earthly pride!"
neutral,"""You look well,"" said the woman; ""you're fat and plump; you are well off."""
neutral,"He'll never cost you anything more, Anne Lisbeth."""
neutral,"Still she said not a word of all this; she could not relieve her heart by telling the laborer's wife, lest the latter should think she did not enjoy her former position at the castle."
neutral,"She had brought coffee and chicory with her, for she thought it would be a charity to the poor woman to give them to her to boil a cup of coffee, and then she would take a cup herself."
neutral,But when she came to him she found that he would not be ready to start till the evening of the next day.
neutral,"Anne Lisbeth walked on, thinking of nothing at all, as people say, or rather her thoughts wandered, but not away from her, for thought is never absent from us, it only slumbers."
neutral,"The germ of every vice and every virtue lies in our heart, in yours and in mine; they lie like little grains of seed, till a ray of sunshine, or the touch of an evil hand, or you turn the corner to the right or to the left, and the decision is made."
neutral,"Anne Lisbeth walked on thus with her senses half asleep, but the thoughts were fermenting within her."
neutral,"She had committed no crime against the law of the land; she was an honorable person, in a good position- that she knew."
neutral,Now when might that have been washed overboard?
neutral,"Her child, her own child, which she had never loved, lay now buried in the sea, and might rise up, like a spectre, from the waters, and cry, ""Hold fast; carry me to consecrated ground!"""
neutral,"She would go there at once, and there she would dig."
neutral,Then we can find no excuse for ourselves; the deed is there and bears witness against us.
neutral,"We are horrified at the thought of what we have carried within us, and at the consciousness that we have not overcome the evil which has its origin in thoughtlessness and pride."
neutral,Anne Lisbeth now experienced in thought what we have clothed in words.
neutral,"Silently, as the cloud-shadows in the moonshine, a spectral apparition flitted by her; she had heard of it before."
neutral,"The legend says that every night, at twelve o'clock, he drove into his castleyard and out again."
neutral,"And the cock crowed, and the day dawned in the east, and the grave was only half dug."
neutral,"The spectre of the shore, her own child, had come to her the night before, and had said to her, ""Thou hast dug me only half a grave: but thou hast now, for a year and a day, buried me altogether in thy heart, and it is there a mother can best hide her child!"""
neutral,"And then he gave her back her lost soul, and brought her into the church."
neutral,"In winter no ships sail by, for the whole Sound is covered with ice as far as the Swedish coast, and has quite the appearance of a high-road."
neutral,"On each Christmas-eve an angel comes to him and tells him that all he has dreamed is true, and that he may go to sleep again in peace, as Denmark is not yet in any real danger; but should danger ever come, then Holger Danske will rouse himself, and the table will burst asunder as he draws out his beard."
neutral,"And now he had carved Holger Danske, who stood there erect and proud, with his long beard, holding in one hand his broad battle-axe, while with the other he leaned on the Danish arms."
neutral,"But the old grandfather remained sitting at his work and carving away at the last part of it, which was the Danish arms."
neutral,"The hearts in the Danish arms grew more and more red; while the lions, with gold crowns on their heads, were leaping up."
neutral,"The third lion reminded him of Margaret, who united Denmark, Sweden, and Norway."
neutral,"The first led him to a dark, narrow prison, in which sat a prisoner, a beautiful woman, daughter of Christian the Fourth, Eleanor Ulfeld, and the flame became a rose on her bosom, and its blossoms were not more pure than the heart of this noblest and best of all Danish women."
neutral,"In a peasant woman's humble room stood Frederick the Sixth, writing his name with chalk on the beam."
neutral,"The flame trembled on his breast and in his heart, and it was in the peasant's room that his heart became one for the Danish arms."
neutral,"That was my idea, and there stands his likeness."""
neutral,"The wooden figure threw a gigantic shadow on the wall, and even on part of the ceiling; it seemed as if the real Holger Danske stood behind it, for the shadow moved; but this was no doubt caused by the flame of the lamp not burning steadily."
neutral,"The ships sailed by and saluted the castle with the boom of the cannon, and Kronenburg returned the salute, ""Boom, boom."""
neutral,"But the roaring cannons did not awake Holger Danske, for they meant only ""Good morning,"" and ""Thank you."""
neutral,"""There is still one thing that could save her,"" said one of the wisest among them."
neutral,"Then from all parts came those who brought roses that bloomed in every garden, but they were not the right sort."
neutral,The flower must be one from the garden of love; but which of the roses there showed forth the highest and purest love?
neutral,"The blood which flows from the breast of a hero who dies for his country is sacred, and his memory is sweet, and no rose can be redder than the blood which flows from his veins."
neutral,"""I have seen it, and a loftier and purer rose does not bloom."
neutral,I saw it on the cheeks of the queen.
neutral,"She had taken off her golden crown, and through the long, dreary night, she carried her sick child in her arms."
neutral,"She looked up to heaven with all the purity and love of her young spirit, in all the expression of the highest and purest love."""
neutral,"A SOLDIER came marching along the high road: ""Left, right- left, right."""
neutral,"""Get money,"" she replied; ""for you must know that when you reach the ground under the tree, you will find yourself in a large hall, lighted up by three hundred lamps; you will then see three doors, which can be easily opened, for the keys are in all the locks."
neutral,"You can then open the chest, and take from it as many pence as you please, they are only copper pence; but if you would rather have silver money, you must go into the second chamber."
neutral,"The dog who sits on this chest is very dreadful; his eyes are as big as a tower, but do not mind him."
neutral,"""No,"" said the witch; ""but I do not ask for a single penny."
neutral,"Then he tied up all his money in her apron. and slung it on his back like a bundle, put the tinderbox in his pocket, and walked off to the nearest town."
neutral,"The next day, however, he procured some good clothes and proper boots, so that our soldier soon became known as a fine gentleman, and the people visited him, and told him all the wonders that were to be seen in the town, and of the king's beautiful daughter, the princess."
neutral,"""Where can I see her?"" asked the soldier."
neutral,"""She is not to be seen at all,"" they said; ""she lives in a large copper castle, surrounded by walls and towers."
neutral,"""I should like very much to see her,"" thought the soldier; but he could not obtain permission to do so."
neutral,"So he was obliged to leave his elegant rooms, and live in a little garret under the roof, where he had to clean his own boots, and even mend them with a large needle."
neutral,The soldier very soon discovered after this the value of the tinder-box.
neutral,After a while he began to think it was very strange that no one could get a look at the princess.
neutral,"""It is midnight,"" said the soldier, ""yet I should very much like to see the princess, if only for a moment."""
neutral,"She was lying on the dog's back asleep, and looked so lovely, that every one who saw her would know she was a real princess."
neutral,"But the old lady put on water boots, and ran after him as quickly as he did, and found that he carried the princess into a large house."
neutral,She thought it would help her to remember the place if she made a large cross on the door with a piece of chalk.
neutral,"No, my dear husband, it must be that one,"" said the queen, pointing to a second door having a cross also."
neutral,"She took her large gold scissors, cut a piece of silk into squares, and made a neat little bag."
neutral,And now we shall see what happened.
neutral,"Then they drove to the castle, in which were lofty halls and splendid drawing-rooms."
neutral,"Pure white curtains fluttered before the open windows, and beautiful flowers stood in shining, transparent vases; and in one of them, which looked as if it had been cut out of newly fallen snow, the apple-branch was placed, among some fresh, light twigs of beech."
neutral,"Then the branch became proud, which was very much like human nature."
neutral,"So thought the apple-branch, as he stood before the open window, from which he could see out over gardens and fields, where there were flowers and plants enough for him to think and reflect upon; some rich and beautiful, some poor and humble indeed."
neutral,"There is a difference indeed, and so there ought to be, or we should all be equals."""
neutral,"The sunbeam, the ray of light, knew better."
neutral,"The elder children broke off the flowers with long stems, bent the stalks one round the other, to form links, and made first a chain for the neck, then one to go across the shoulders, and hang down to the waist, and at last a wreath to wear round the head, so that they looked quite splendid in their garlands of green stems and golden flowers."
neutral,"By-and-by an old woman came into the field, and, with a blunt knife without a handle, began to dig round the roots of some of the dandelion-plants, and pull them up."
neutral,"Very cautiously the large leaves were removed, and there appeared the feathery seed-crown of the despised dandelion."
neutral,"""The flowers were at a ball last night, and therefore, it is no wonder they hang their heads."""
neutral,"""But flowers cannot dance?"" cried little Ida."
neutral,"""Yes indeed, they can,"" replied the student."
neutral,"They have a ball almost every night."""
neutral,"The tulips and tiger-lilies are the old ladies who sit and watch the dancing, so that everything may be conducted with order and propriety."""
neutral,"""But,"" said little Ida, ""is there no one there to hurt the flowers for dancing in the king's castle?"""
neutral,"""No one knows anything about it,"" said the student."
neutral,"You know him very well, do you not?"
neutral,"""But how can one flower tell another?"
neutral,"""No, certainly not,"" replied the student; ""but they can make signs."
neutral,"""Yes, to be sure he can."
neutral,Sometimes it would be a man hanging on a gibbet and holding a heart in his hand as if he had been stealing hearts.
neutral,"The flowers did hang their heads, because they had been dancing all night, and were very tired, and most likely they were ill."
neutral,"In the night she awoke; she had been dreaming of the flowers and of the student, as well as of the tiresome lawyer who found fault with him."
neutral,"She crept out of her little bed, went softly to the door and looked into the room."
neutral,"They all laughed at him then, but now it seemed to little Ida as if the tall, yellow flower was really like the young lady."
neutral,"At the same moment a loud knocking was heard in the drawer, where Ida's doll Sophy lay with many other toys."
neutral,"Then the door of the room opened, and a number of beautiful flowers danced in."
neutral,"Ida could not imagine where they could come from, unless they were the flowers from the king's garden."
neutral,"Large poppies and peonies had pea-shells for instruments, and blew into them till they were quite red in the face."
neutral,"""This shall be your pretty coffin,"" she said; ""and by and by, when my cousins come to visit me, they shall help me to bury you out in the garden; so that next summer you may grow up again more beautiful than ever."""
neutral,"Her cousins were two good-tempered boys, whose names were James and Adolphus."
neutral,"The two boys walked first, with their crossbows on their shoulders, and little Ida followed, carrying the pretty box containing the dead flowers."
neutral,And there the three famous jumpers were met together in the room.
neutral,"Both of them, the Flea and the Grasshopper, took care to announce who they were, and that they considered themselves entitled to marry a Princess."
neutral,"The Skipjack said nothing, but it was said of him that he thought all the more; and directly the Yard Dog had smelt at him he was ready to assert that the Skipjack was of good family, and formed from the breastbone of an undoubted goose."
neutral,"The old councillor, who had received three medals for holding his tongue, declared that the Skipjack possessed the gift of prophecy; one could tell by his bones whether there would be a severe winter or a mild one; and that's more than one can always tell from the breastbone of the man who writes the almanac."
neutral,And so he had the Princess.
neutral,"The Grasshopper seated himself out in the ditch, and thought and considered how things happened in the world."
neutral,"I should also like to kiss those roses down in the water, which are so much like us, and the pretty little birds down in the nest."
neutral,But ours are finer.
neutral,"A peasant boy rode on one, and he had taken off all his clothes except his large broad black hat."
neutral,"""I should like to go out into the world for once,"" said one; ""but here at home among our green leaves it is beautiful too."
neutral,"I daresay it will be taken away; then we shall, perhaps, have some corn growing here."
neutral,"The boys came running up and seized her, and in no gentle way either."
neutral,"On seeing the sparrow which the boys had brought, and which they said they did not want, he asked, ""Shall we make it look very pretty?"""
neutral,"""I daresay I shall have more wives and children than you,"" said the second."
neutral,That was their way of looking foolish.
neutral,"They could fly a little; by practice they learned to improve, and at last they agreed upon a sign by which to recognise each other if they should meet in the world later on."
neutral,But this greatness did not last long.
neutral,"Thick smoke still rose from the ruins, but the rose-bush stood yonder, fresh, blooming, and untouched, every flower and every twig being reflected in the clear water."
neutral,"""How beautifully the roses bloom before the ruined house,"" exclaimed a passer-by."
neutral,That's what he has now for keeping the nest.
neutral,And away they went.
neutral,"On a beautiful sunny autumn day- one could almost have believed it was still the middle of summer- there hopped about in the dry clean-swept courtyard before the principal entrance of the Hall a number of black, white, and gaily-coloured pigeons, all shining in the sunlight."
neutral,"By this means they recognised each other, for they were the sparrows from the nest on the burned house."
neutral,"The pigeons strutted round one another, puffed out their chests mightily, and had their own private views and opinions."
neutral,Stand in groups!
neutral,"Curoo, curoo, curoo!"""
neutral,"What is it?"""
neutral,"How comes this in a room at the Hall?"""
neutral,"But here it is larger than a peacock."""
neutral,She flew down into the courtyard: there everything was extremely fine.
neutral,"But to-day two old sparrows and a young one answered with a ""peep"" and the thrice-repeated scrape with the left foot."
neutral,"That appeared to them to be really too much, but since all the people showed their love for the roses, they did not wish to be behindhand."
neutral,And so they really were.
neutral,"The architect had planted it upon Thorwaldsen's grave, where it bloomed as an emblem of 'the beautiful' and yielded fragrant red rose-leaves to be carried as mementoes to distant lands."
neutral,"""Yes, they are really our old neighbours; we remember their origin near the pond."
neutral,"Ah! there's a faded leaf; I can see that quite plainly."""
neutral,"But they were not talking of the moon, but of a large, old stone that lay below in the courtyard not very far from the kitchen door."
neutral,"They were a very worthy old couple, I can remember them well in the days of my boyhood."
neutral,The old woman died first; that day is still quite vividly before my eyes.
neutral,"Ah, well, so it is; then I was but a child, and now I am old, as old as Preben Schwane then was."
neutral,"In the evening the stone was taken to the churchyard, and laid on the grave."
neutral,"But the youngest child in the room, a boy, with large, earnest eyes, mounted upon a chair behind the window curtains, and looked out into the yard, where the moon was pouring a flood of light on the old gravestone,- the stone that had always appeared to him so dull and flat, but which lay there now like a great leaf out of a book of history."
neutral,The seed of this hour shall ripen in the course of years into a beautiful poem.
neutral,"He brought enormous wealth home from the conquered towns, and gradually accumulated in his residence riches which could nowhere be equalled."
neutral,"The wicked prince showered thousands of bullets upon him, but they rebounded from his shining wings and fell down like ordinary hailstones."
neutral,"And he spent seven years in the construction of wonderful ships to sail through the air, and had darts cast from the hardest steel to break the walls of heaven with."
neutral,"He had a golden shoe on each foot, and why was this?"
neutral,"""Yes, certainly; golden shoes,"" replied the beetle."
neutral,"""Go along with you,"" said the farrier."
neutral,"After a while the weather cleared up a little, and the beetle was able to rub the water from his eyes, and look about him."
neutral,"""Have you ever been in the Emperor's stable?"" asked the beetle."
neutral,But the frogs either did not or would not understand him.
neutral,"""Our son,"" said another, ""had scarcely crept out of the egg, when he was off on his travels."
neutral,"But of course the beetle's intentions were serious, and after a while our friend was engaged."
neutral,"""Well, she can be unmarried again, and remain here with my other daughters,"" said the mother."
neutral,This is a capital store-room.
neutral,"First, he was wrapped, in a vine-leaf, and put into a warm trousers' pocket."
neutral,Then the boy went quickly towards a lake that lay at the end of the garden.
neutral,"Now he was a sailor, and had to sail away."
neutral,Then a fly came and paid him a visit.
neutral,"Then, when I have made a step forward in the world, and found out a comfortable position, just as I could wish it to be, one of these human boys comes and ties me up, and leaves me to the mercy of the wild waves, while the emperor's favorite horse goes prancing about proudly on his golden shoes."
neutral,"A boat, in which were a few young girls, came rowing up."
neutral,"Away flew the beetle, straight through the open window of a large building; there he sank down, tired and exhausted, exactly on the mane of the emperor's favorite horse, who was standing in his stable; and the beetle found himself at home again."
neutral,"Ah, I remember now,- that's a good thought,- he asked me why the golden shoes were given to the horse."
neutral,"It had been taken down from its high position, in consequence of a crack in the metal which prevented it from ever chiming again, and a new bell now occupied its place."
neutral,"The old church bell had long been quite forgotten, and no one imagined it would ever again be sent to the melting furnace to make it as it was before."
neutral,Equally impossible would it have been to believe that the tones of the old bell still echoed in the heart of the boy from Marbach; or that one day they would ring out loud enough and strong enough to be heard all over the world.
neutral,"The light streamed forth from thousands of lamps, and the rockets shot upwards towards the sky, filling the air with showers of colored fiery sparks."
neutral,"The old church bell had still some comfort; it stood in the shelter of the church wall in Marbach, once so elevated, now quite forgotten."
neutral,"The wind roared around it, and could have readily related the story of its origin and of its sweet chimes, and the wind could also tell of him to whom he had brought fresh air when, in the woods of a neighboring country, he had sunk down exhausted with fatigue, with no other worldly possessions than hope for the future, and a written leaf from ""Fiesco."""
neutral,"The old bell was, after a time, carried away to a greater distance than any one, even the warder in the bell tower, ever imagined; and the bell in the breast of the young man was heard in countries where his feet had never wandered."
neutral,"It was, as we have said, carried far away from Marbach and sold as old copper; then sent to Bavaria to be melted down in a furnace."
neutral,"The table on which the tin soldiers stood, was covered with other playthings, but the most attractive to the eye was a pretty little paper castle."
neutral,Through the small windows the rooms could be seen.
neutral,"In front of the castle a number of little trees surrounded a piece of looking-glass, which was intended to represent a transparent lake."
neutral,"In front of these was fixed a glittering tinsel rose, as large as her whole face."
neutral,"The little lady was a dancer, and she stretched out both her arms, and raised one of her legs so high, that the tin soldier could not see it at all, and he thought that she, like himself, had only one leg."
neutral,"""That is the wife for me,"" he thought; ""but she is too grand, and lives in a castle, while I have only a box to live in, five-and-twenty of us altogether, that is no place for her."
neutral,"Then he laid himself at full length on the table behind a snuff-box that stood upon it, so that he could peep at the little delicate lady, who continued to stand on one leg without losing her balance."
neutral,"The servant maid and the little boy went down stairs directly to look for him; but he was nowhere to be seen, although once they nearly trod upon him."
neutral,"Presently it began to rain, and the drops fell faster and faster, till there was a heavy shower."
neutral,"Suddenly the boat shot under a bridge which formed a part of a drain, and then it was as dark as the tin soldier's box."
neutral,"At the end of the tunnel the drain fell into a large canal over a steep place, which made it as dangerous for him as a waterfall would be to us."
neutral,"""Farewell, warrior! ever brave, Drifting onward to thy grave."""
neutral,"The fish swam to and fro, making the most wonderful movements, but at last he became quite still."
neutral,"He felt himself melting away, but he still remained firm with his gun on his shoulder."
neutral,"There he stood upon the cupboard, high and lofty, looking down upon everything else in the room."
neutral,"A large doll, still handsome, though rather old, for her neck had been mended, lay inside one of the drawers which was partly open."
neutral,"But in his reply, he said, if he had to take a part, he must enjoy the sport from his own home; they were to arrange for him to do so; and so they did."
neutral,"Some wanted to begin with a comedy, and afterwards to have a tea party and a discussion for mental improvement, but they commenced with the latter first."
neutral,"So he made up his mind to remember one of them in his will, as the one to be buried with him in the family vault, whenever that event should happen."
neutral,"All the while, each one thought most of himself, or of what the money-pig could be thinking."
neutral,Then the pennies hopped and danced about in the most amusing manner.
neutral,The building is the Warton Almshouse.
neutral,"""Scarcely have the violets come forth, but there on the rampart, just opposite the beautiful Castle of Rosenberg, there is a tree bright with the first green buds."
neutral,"He had also a nightingale, which could sing as if every sweet melody was in its throat."
neutral,This rose and the nightingale he wished to give to the princess; and therefore both were put into big silver cases and sent to her.
neutral,"""Good day, emperor,"" he said, ""could you not give me some employment at the court?"""
neutral,"""There are so many,"" replied the emperor, ""who apply for places, that for the present I have no vacancy, but I will remember you."
neutral,"There were little bells round the rim, and when the water began to boil in it, the bells began to play the old tune:"
neutral,"""What will you take for your pot?"" asked the lady."
neutral,"I really cannot tell you,"" replied the lady."
neutral,"""We know who will eat soup and pancakes; we know who will eat porridge and cutlets; oh, how interesting!"""
neutral,"""Very interesting, indeed,"" said the mistress of the household."
neutral,"""But you must not betray me, for I am the emperor's daughter."""
neutral,"Go down and ask him what the instrument costs; but I shall not kiss him again."""
neutral,"He pulled up his shoes, for they were down at the heels, and he was very quick about it."
neutral,"When he had come down into the courtyard he walked quite softly, and the ladies were so busily engaged in counting the kisses, that all should be fair, that they did not notice the emperor."
neutral,"""One is born to that,"" said the cucumber to itself."
neutral,"The hens, the ducks, and all the animals in the next yard are creatures too."
neutral,"Where does she dwell?"" said the guardian angel."
neutral,To this child she must come.
neutral,"It was in a large house with dark windows and empty rooms, in which a peculiar stillness reigned."
neutral,"""Do you see the shimmer of the rainbow, which unites earth to heaven?"""
neutral,"Then we glance at the pearl of Sorrow, in which are concealed the wings which shall carry us away to eternal happiness."
neutral,"The younger was not Fortune herself, but the chambermaid of one of Fortune's attendants, who carries about her more trifling gifts."
neutral,"These goloshes have the property of making every one who puts them on imagine himself in any place he wishes, or that he exists at any period."
neutral,"""Does the gentleman wish to be ferried over the Holm?"" asked one."
neutral,"A few miserable-looking wooden booths, for the accommodation of Dutch watermen, stood on the opposite shore."
neutral,"Suppose I were to go back now and say how ill I feel, I fear it would look so ridiculous, and it is not very likely that I should find any one up."""
neutral,"A number of people, consisting of seamen, Copenhagen citizens, and a few scholars, sat in deep conversation over their mugs, and took very little notice of the new comer."
neutral,Then she spoke to him in German.
neutral,"Those who sat near him, and heard what he said, looked at him in great astonishment, and one of them rose, took off his hat respectfully, and said in a very serious manner, ""You must certainly be a very learned man, monsieur."""
neutral,"""I suppose it is quite new, and published by Heiberg."""
neutral,"So far all had passed off very well; but now one of the citizens began to speak of a terrible pestilence which had been raging a few years before, meaning the plague of 1484."
neutral,"The counsellor thought he referred to the cholera, and they could discuss this without finding out the mistake."
neutral,In the course of conversation he had forgotten all that had happened previously.
neutral,One of them had a cap on her head of two colors.
neutral,"They poured out the wine, bowed their heads, and withdrew."
neutral,"He became at last desperate; and when one of them said he was tipsy, he did not doubt the man's word in the least- only begged them to get a droschky; and then they thought he was speaking the Muscovite language."
neutral,"He tried it; but before he reached the entry, the rest discovered what he was about, and seized him by the feet, when, luckily for him, off came the goloshes, and with them vanished the whole enchantment."
neutral,THE WATCHMAN'S ADVENTURES
neutral,"They are lying just by his door."""
neutral,"Gladly would the honest man have rung, and given them in, for a light was still burning, but he did not wish to disturb the other people in the house; so he let them lie."
neutral,"There's that man can lie down in his warm bed, but he does not do so."
neutral,"As he uttered this wish, the goloshes which he had put on took effect, and the watchman at once became the lieutenant."
neutral,"""Oh were I rich in truth and peace below, I need not then my poverty bewail."
neutral,"It seemed to me as if I were the lieutenant up yonder, but there was no happiness for me."
neutral,"If that were true, it would be very delightful, but I don't believe it."
neutral,"In a very few seconds the watchman had travelled more than two hundred thousand miles to the moon, which is formed of a lighter material than our earth, and may be said to be as soft as new fallen snow."
neutral,They likewise talked politics.
neutral,He sat lifeless on the steps.
neutral,"His staff had fallen out of his hand, and his eyes stared at the moon, about which his honest soul was wandering."
neutral,"The same day he was allowed to leave, but the goloshes remained at the hospital."
neutral,"Every inhabitant of Copenhagen knows what the entrance to Frederick's Hospital is like; but as most probably a few of those who read this little tale may not reside in Copenhagen, we will give a short description of it."
neutral,"There lay the goloshes, which the watchman had forgotten."
neutral,"The goloshes answered that purpose very well, but his body had to follow, and this was impossible."
neutral,"The goloshes of Fortune had placed him in this terrible position, and unfortunately it never occurred to him to wish himself free."
neutral,"The rain poured, and not a creature could be seen in the street."
neutral,"But we must not suppose it was all over; no, indeed, there was worse to come yet."
neutral,There may be some well stored with good articles.
neutral,"Ah, yes,"" he sighed, ""I know one, in which everything is solid, but a servant is there already, and that is the only thing against it."
neutral,"Gladly would he have fallen on his knees in such a sacred place; but he was carried on to another heart, still, however, listening to the tones of the organ, and feeling himself that he had become another and a better man."
neutral,"But these mirrors magnified in an astonishing degree; in the middle of the floor sat, like the Grand Lama, the insignificant I of the owner, astonished at the contemplation of his own features."
neutral,"The watchman, whom we of course have not forgotten, thought, after a while, of the goloshes which he had found and taken to the hospital; so he went and fetched them."
neutral,"""It would require even more than the eye of a shoemaker to know one pair from the other."""
neutral,"The goloshes of Fortune were the wet pair; and, besides, why should not a clerk in a police office be wrong sometimes?"
neutral,"We will not grudge him this little walk, it was just the thing to do him good after sitting so much."
neutral,"You can roam about where you will, while such as we are tied by the foot."""
neutral,"""But it is fastened to the bread-tree,"" replied the poet."
neutral,"You should try how you would like to listen to all the trivial things in a court of justice."""
neutral,"By most poets what he had said would be considered common-place, or as the Germans call it, ""insipid."""
neutral,"Amidst shouting and cheers the ships were tarred and rigged, and then they sailed to foreign lands."
neutral,"""I remain here, and always shall remain, sitting at my post at the police office, and letting others take passports to distant lands."
neutral,"""These will give me something else to think of,"" said he."
neutral,"""It is light that adorns me,"" said the flower."
neutral,"""But the air gives you the breath of life,"" whispered the poet."
neutral,"I am quite sure if I recollect all this tomorrow, it will appear utterly ridiculous and absurd."
neutral,I have had this happen to me before.
neutral,"I wonder what will be the end of it."""
neutral,"""Tweet, tweet,"" sighed he, ""what a dreadful snowstorm!"" and then he became silent."
neutral,"""Do you remember,"" said the canary, ""the pretty maidens who used to dance in the tents that were spread out beneath the sweet blossoms?"
neutral,"I am well fed, and treated politely."
neutral,Let us be men now.
neutral,I have deep knowledge and wit.
neutral,"""You little gray Danish bird,"" said the canary, ""you also have become a prisoner."
neutral,"He put on the goloshes, and was soon in the garden, which contained only one plum-tree and one apple-tree; yet, in a town, even a small garden like this is a great advantage."
neutral,"His head ached, his back was stiff, and the blood had ceased to circulate, so that his feet were swelled and pinched by his boots."
neutral,He wavered in a condition between sleeping and waking.
neutral,"""How lovely to my wondering eyes Mont Blanc's fair summits gently rise; 'Tis sweet to breathe the mountain air,- If you have gold enough to spare."""
neutral,"Presently it began to snow, and the wind blew keen and cold."
neutral,"Here stood a lonely inn, and close by it a number of crippled beggars had placed themselves; the brightest among them looked, to quote the words of Marryat, ""like the eldest son of Famine who had just come of age."""
neutral,"The windows were opened to let in a little fresh air, but quicker than air came in the withered arms and the continual whining sounds, ""Miserabili, eccellenza."
neutral,The supper made its appearance at last.
neutral,"It consisted of watery soup, seasoned with pepper and rancid oil."
neutral,How close the air felt in that room; the heat overpowered him.
neutral,"In fact, I know in my heart very well what I want."
neutral,"I wish to attain the greatest of all happiness."""
neutral,"""Stern death, thy chilling silence waketh dread; Yet in thy darkest hour there may be light."
neutral,"Man's greatest sorrows often are a part Of hidden griefs, concealed from human eyes, Which press far heavier on the lonely heart Than now the earth that on his coffin lies."""
neutral,And she drew the goloshes from his feet.
neutral,"Care vanished, and with her the goloshes; doubtless she looked upon them as her own property."
neutral,"The night is splendid in the gleam of the Northern Lights, and in the glitter of innumerable twinkling stars."
neutral,"And we listen to this story: By the open sea was a giant's grave; and on the grave-mound sat at midnight the spirit of the buried hero, who had been a king."
neutral,"The golden circlet gleamed on his brow, his hair fluttered in the wind, and he was clad in steel and iron."
neutral,Presently the sailors lowered the anchor and landed.
neutral,"He lays the Runes beneath our tongues, and we know the land of our home."
neutral,"Heaven speaks to us in our native tongue, in the voice of the Bird of Popular Song."
neutral,"The wind is sharp as a two-edged sword, the snow-flakes chase each other; it seems as though it had been snowing for days and weeks, and the snow lies like a great mountain over the whole town, like a heavy dream of the winter night."
neutral,"Everything on the earth is hidden away, only the golden cross of the church, the symbol of faith, arises over the snow grave, and gleams in the blue air and in the bright sunshine."
neutral,"""Grub, grub!"" they cried."
neutral,It is the Bird of Popular Song whom we hear.
neutral,"Hear the story of the year: ""The night of the snow-storm, the heavy dream of the winter night, all shall be dissolved, all shall rise again in the beauteous notes of the Bird of Popular Song, who never dies!"""
neutral,"It is true she had on a pair of slippers when she left home, but they were not of much use."
neutral,"So the little girl went on with her little naked feet, which were quite red and blue with the cold."
neutral,"The snowflakes fell on her long, fair hair, which hung in curls on her shoulders, but she regarded them not."
neutral,"She drew one out-""scratch!"" how it sputtered as it burnt!"
neutral,"And what was still more wonderful, the goose jumped down from the dish and waddled across the floor, with a knife and fork in its breast, to the little girl."
neutral,"The Christmas lights rose higher and higher, till they looked to her like the stars in the sky."
neutral,"""She tried to warm herself,"" said some."
neutral,"They entered a long gallery, where the boy had been before."
neutral,"Sometimes the roller and the bucket danced in the air, splashing the water all over the court."
neutral,"""Are you ill? where do you live? have you been here all day?"" were some of the questions asked by the old man."
neutral,"""May I see you paint?"" asked the boy; ""may I see you put the picture on this white canvas?"""
neutral,"His hand moved quickly, and his eye measured the great picture; and though nothing appeared but a faint line, the figure of the Saviour was as clearly visible as in the colored picture."
neutral,"The little boy still sat astride on its back, when he felt something pulling at his clothes."
neutral,"And now here she was in the cold, and not dressed."
neutral,"""Bellissima is gone."
neutral,Then indeed there was a great panic.
neutral,"But Bellissima would not stand still, so she must be bound fast in one position."
neutral,In the year 1834 there was an exhibition in the Academy of Arts at Florence.
neutral,"The glovemaker's boy had also become a great painter, as the picture proved; but the larger picture by its side was a still greater proof of his talent."
neutral,It was a beautiful picture.
neutral,"They carved shoes and spoons, which paid well; therefore no one could justly call Jeppe Jans and his family poor people."
neutral,"Sometimes, when her father had to go as far as the town, he would take Little Christina, who was a year younger than Ib, across the heath to the cottage of Jeppe Jans, and leave her there."
neutral,"Another time they found a few snipes' eggs in the wood, which was a great event."
neutral,"Ib had never been on the heath where Christina's father lived, nor on the river; but at last came an opportunity."
neutral,"Then they returned again up the stream; and as the wind was favorable, two sails were hoisted, which carried the boat on as well as if two horses had been harnessed to it."
neutral,"Ib jumped ashore, and ran a little distance from the boat."
neutral,"""Oh, never mind,"" said Ib; ""we will go home to my father's house."
neutral,The sun was high in the heavens when the two children woke.
neutral,"They thought if they went there they should be warm, and Ib fancied he should be able to see his father's house from such a high spot."
neutral,But there was another surprise and fright in store for them.
neutral,"""Is there, in this nut, a pretty little neckerchief like the one Christina has on her neck?"" asked Ib."
neutral,So Ib held the nut very tight.
neutral,"The first thing Ib did that evening was to take out of his pocket the little black nut, in which the best thing of all was said to be enclosed."
neutral,"Christina will find her two nuts just the same; there will be neither fine clothes or a golden carriage in them."""
neutral,"Winter came; and the new year, and indeed many years passed away; until Ib was old enough to be confirmed, and, therefore, he went during a whole winter to the clergyman of the nearest village to be prepared."
neutral,And so they parted.
neutral,"His father had been dead some time, and his mother kept no farm servants."
neutral,"She had come to pay them a visit, and to spend the day."
neutral,"Then they wandered up the great ridge, and looked across the stream to the heath, where the little hills were covered with the flowering broom."
neutral,"They had only a few more hours to remain together, for Christina was obliged to return that evening to the neighboring village, to be ready for the carriage which was to start the next morning early for Herning."
neutral,"The words were not what he wished to say, so he tore up the page."
neutral,"Ask your own heart, Christina, and think over carefully what awaits you if you take me for your husband, for I possess very little in the world."
neutral,"Ever your sincere friend, IB."""
neutral,"This letter was sent, and Christina received it in due time."
neutral,The black earth- the dark grave- was the best thing for him now.
neutral,"The old innkeeper and his wife died one after the other; and the whole of their property, many thousand dollars, was inherited by their son."
neutral,So Ib went in the ferry-boat from Aarhus to Copenhagen.
neutral,Not a creature could be seen.
neutral,"He had given up his certain appointment, and travelled for six months in foreign lands, and, on his return, had lived in great style, and got into terrible debt."
neutral,One morning his corpse was found in the canal.
neutral,"Ib was to her both father and mother; her own parents had vanished from her memory, as a dream-picture vanishes alike from childhood and age."
neutral,"This house was inhabited by poor people, but the deepest poverty was apparent in the garret lodging in the gable."
neutral,"I remember when I went out to a picnic with the furrier's family, on the day his daughter was betrothed,- it seems as if it only happened yesterday."
neutral,"He thought of the blazing furnace in the factory, where he had been blown into life; he remembered how hot it felt when he was placed in the heated oven, the home from which he sprang, and that he had a strong inclination to leap out again directly; but after a while it became cooler, and he found himself very comfortable."
neutral,"At last it was filled with rich and costly wine, a cork was placed in it, and sealed down."
neutral,"The sweetest fresh butter and the finest bread were put into the basket by the furrier's daughter herself, for she packed it."
neutral,"The young people wandered away into the green wood, and talked together."
neutral,It fell among the rushes on the borders of a little woodland lake.
neutral,"He had been there the day before to say farewell, and his mother was now very busy packing up various things for him to take with him on his voyage."
neutral,"The liquid which they now poured into the bottle was not like the red wine with which it had once been filled; these were bitter drops, but they are of great use sometimes-for the stomach."
neutral,It was taken on board (for Peter Jensen was one of the crew) the very same ship in which the young mate was to sail.
neutral,"It outlived the storms and the calm, it struck against no rocks, was not devoured by sharks, but drifted on for more than a year, sometimes towards the north, sometimes towards the south, just as the current carried it."
neutral,"Ah, yes! where was the furrier's daughter? and where was the land which might lie nearest to her home?"
neutral,"Whenever any strangers arrived, the paper was taken out and turned over and over, so that the address, which was only written in pencil, became almost illegible, and at last no one could distinguish any letters on it at all."
neutral,Out in the garden there was a great festival.
neutral,"It was a beautiful evening, and the weather mild and clear."
neutral,"In the borders were placed bottles, each containing a light, and among them the bottle with which we are acquainted, and whose fate it was, one day, to be only a bottle neck, and to serve as a water-glass to a bird's-cage."
neutral,"Close before the bottle passed a single pair, like the bridal pair- the mate and the furrier's daughter- who had so long ago wandered in the wood."
neutral,"And so we often pass each other in the world when we meet, as did these two, even while together in the same town."
neutral,The bottle saw it all from the basket in which he lay close to a live rabbit.
neutral,"The bottle had no time to think, when raised so suddenly; and before it was aware, it reached the highest point it had ever attained in its life."
neutral,"The balloon was already far away, and very soon the bottle was far away also; for it fell upon a roof, and broke in pieces."
neutral,"As it hung there in the bird's-cage, it could hear the noise and murmur of the people in the street below, as well as the conversation of the old maid in the room within."
neutral,"Many thoughts came into her mind; but the thought never came, that quite close to her, in that very window, was a remembrance of those olden times,- the neck of the bottle which had, as it were shouted for joy when the cork flew out with a bang on the betrothal day."
neutral,"""They can do no harm."""
neutral,"""See,"" she said, ""How quiet your father stands, although he is only on one leg."""
neutral,"""I will teach you to fly, and when you have learnt, we will fly into the meadows, and pay a visit to the frogs, who will bow themselves to us in the water, and cry 'Croak, croak,' and then we shall eat them up; that will be fun."""
neutral,"Therefore you must take pains and learn, so as to be ready when the drilling begins."""
neutral,"""After the great review is over, we shall fly away to warm countries far from hence, where there are mountains and forests."
neutral,"""No, they will not freeze and fall into pieces,"" said the mother, ""but they will be very cold, and be obliged to sit all day in a dark, gloomy room, while we shall be flying about in foreign lands, where there are blooming flowers and warm sunshine."""
neutral,"Time passed on, and the young storks grew so large that they could stand upright in the nest and look about them."
neutral,"He would lay his head quite round over his tail, and clatter with his beak, as if it had been a rattle; and then he would tell them stories all about the marshes and fens."
neutral,"Once, twice, once, twice- that is it."
neutral,"Now you will be able to take care of yourselves in the world."""
neutral,"""No; leave them alone,"" said the mother."
neutral,"Of all the boys in the street who sang the mocking song about the storks, not one was so determined to go on with it as he who first began it."
neutral,"""If you get on badly there, the general will thrust his beak through you, and you will be killed, as the boys said, though not exactly in the same manner."
neutral,Then the review commenced.
neutral,The prettiest little babies lie there dreaming more sweetly than they will ever dream in the time to come.
neutral,"Then how Little Claus would smack his whip over all five horses, they were as good as his own on that one day."
neutral,"The sun shone brightly, and the church bells were ringing merrily as the people passed by, dressed in their best clothes, with their prayer-books under their arms."
neutral,They were going to hear the clergyman preach.
neutral,"But after a while he took off the dead horse's skin, and hung the hide to dry in the wind."
neutral,"He had a very long way to go, and had to pass through a dark, gloomy forest."
neutral,Near the road stood a large farmhouse.
neutral,"So Little Claus climbed to the roof of the shed, and while he turned himself to get comfortable, he discovered that the wooden shutters, which were closed, did not reach to the tops of the windows of the farmhouse, so that he could see into a room, in which a large table was laid out with wine, roast meat, and a splendid fish."
neutral,"""All right,"" said the farmer; ""but we must have something to eat first."""
neutral,"The farmer was very hungry, and ate his porridge with a good appetite, but Little Claus could not help thinking of the nice roast meat, fish and pies, which he knew were in the oven."
neutral,"What will he be like?"""
neutral,"Now then, I have got up my courage, but don't let him come too near me."""
neutral,"""Stop, I must ask the conjuror,"" said Little Claus; so he trod on the bag, and stooped his ear down to listen."
neutral,"""What does he say?"""
neutral,"So after that he was obliged to drink again, and they sat and drank till far into the night."
neutral,"A new bridge had lately been built across it, and in the middle of this bridge Little Claus stopped, and said, loud enough to be heard by the sexton, ""Now what shall I do with this stupid chest; it is as heavy as if it were full of stones: I shall be tired if I roll it any farther, so I may as well throw it in the river; if it swims after me to my house, well and good, and if not, it will not much matter."""
neutral,"The sexton crept out, pushed the empty chest into the water, and went to his house, then he measured out a whole bushel full of gold for Little Claus, who had already received one from the farmer, so that now he had a barrow full."
neutral,Then he sent a boy to Great Claus to borrow a bushel measure.
neutral,"All the shoemakers and tanners came running, and asked how much he wanted for them."
neutral,"There he determined that she should lie the whole night, while he seated himself in a chair in a corner of the room as he had often done before."
neutral,"It is a good thing for my old grandmother that she was already dead, or he would have taken her life."""
neutral,"Then he placed the old woman on the back seat, so that she might not fall out as he drove, and rode away through the wood."
neutral,"By sunrise they reached a large inn, where Little Claus stopped and went to get something to eat."
neutral,"""Yes, certainly I will,"" replied the landlord; and, pouring out a glass of mead, he carried it out to the dead grandmother, who sat upright in the cart."
neutral,"I must go and see for myself."""
neutral,"So he went home, took a hatchet, and killed his old grandmother with one blow."
neutral,So as soon as he reached home he took the largest sack he could find and went over to Little Claus.
neutral,"Presently an old cattle driver, with snowy hair, passed by, carrying a large staff in his hand, with which he drove a large herd of cows and oxen before him."
neutral,"""Will you take care of my cattle?"" said the old man, as he crept into the bag."
neutral,"So he walked on to the river, which was deep and broad, and threw the sack containing the old drover into the water, believing it to be Little Claus."
neutral,"""Yes,"" said Little Claus; ""you threw me into the river about half an hour ago."""
neutral,"""But wherever did you get all these fine beasts?"" asked Great Claus."
neutral,"""These beasts are sea-cattle,"" replied Little Claus."
neutral,"""Oh, there's not much fear of that,"" he replied; still he put a large stone into the bag, and then tied it tightly, and gave it a push."
neutral,"""Plump!"""
neutral,"""I'm afraid he will not find any cattle,"" said Little Claus, and then he drove his own beasts homewards."
neutral,"""Hauschen,"" means a little house; and for many years it consisted only of a few small houses, which were scarcely larger than the wooden booths we see in the market-places at fair time."
neutral,"This was a long time ago, so long indeed that our grandfathers, and even great-grandfathers, would speak of those days as ""olden times;"" indeed, many centuries have passed since then."
neutral,"The German beer was very good, and there were many sorts- from Bremen, Prussia, and Brunswick- and quantities of all sorts of spices, saffron, aniseed, ginger, and especially pepper; indeed, pepper was almost the chief article sold here; so it happened at last that the German clerks in Denmark got their nickname of ""pepper gentry."""
neutral,"It had been made a condition with these clerks that they should not marry; so that those who lived to be old had to take care of themselves, to attend to their own comforts, and even to light their own fires, when they had any to light."
neutral,"From this, all unmarried men, who have attained a certain age, are called, in Denmark, ""pepper gentry;"" and this must be remembered by all those who wish to understand the story."
neutral,"The boys in Denmark make a song of it, thus:-"
neutral,"Go to sleep, it will do you good."""
neutral,And why not?
neutral,"We have seen the portraits of our great-grandfathers dressed in this way; but the ""pepper gentlemen"" had no money to spare to have their portraits taken, though one of them would have made a very interesting picture for us now, if taken as he appeared standing behind his counter, or going to church, or on holidays."
neutral,"After this fashion was Anthony dressed on holidays and festivals, excepting that, instead of a high-crowned hat, he wore a kind of bonnet, and under it a knitted cap, a regular nightcap, to which he was so accustomed that it was always on his head; he had two, nightcaps I mean, not heads."
neutral,"Anthony was one of the oldest of the clerks, and just the subject for a painter."
neutral,"People knew that he came from Bremen; it was not exactly his home, although his master resided there."
neutral,To be a stranger in a strange land is a bitter lot; no one notices you unless you happen to stand in their way.
neutral,"Often, when it was dark night outside, with rain or snow falling, the place looked quite deserted and gloomy."
neutral,"There were no lamps in the street, excepting a very small one, which hung at one end of the street, before a picture of the Virgin, which had been painted on the wall."
neutral,"He would draw the coverlet closer round him, pull his nightcap over his eyes, and try to turn his thoughts from trade, and from the labors of the day, to olden times."
neutral,"More grand and venerable to him seemed the old oaks around the proud baronial castle, where the creeping plants hung over the stony summits of the rocks; sweeter was the perfume there of the apple-blossom than in all the land of Denmark."
neutral,"Then they cut it in two, and each of them took half."
neutral,"A whole apple-tree will come out, but not directly."""
neutral,"I did so with my flowers, but only twice; I wanted to see if they were growing."
neutral,"Day after day, and week after week, till the plant became quite a tree."
neutral,"In the neighborhood of Eisenach stretches a ridge of stony mountains, one of which has a rounded outline, and shows itself above the rest without tree, bush, or grass on its barren summits."
neutral,"She is also called ""Lady Halle,"" as every child round Eisenach well knows."
neutral,"Little Molly and Anthony often stood by this mountain, and one day Molly said, ""Do you dare to knock and say, 'Lady Halle, Lady Halle, open the door: Tannhauser is here!'"""
neutral,But Anthony did not dare.
neutral,Then Molly was the only one who dared to resist him.
neutral,"Saint Elizabeth, the tutelar saint of the land, the pious princess of Thuringia, whose good deeds have been immortalized in so many places through stories and legends, had greater beauty and more real grace."
neutral,"Her picture hung in the chapel, surrounded by silver lamps; but it did not in the least resemble Molly."
neutral,"In our time, it would be only a journey of a few hours, but then it took more than a day and a night to travel so far eastward from Eisenbach to a town still called Weimar, on the borders of Thuringia."
neutral,"This song was often in his mouth, and he sung or whistled it on a moonlight night, when he rode on horseback along the deep, hollow way, on his road to Weimar, to visit Molly."
neutral,"He wished to arrive unexpectedly, and so indeed he did."
neutral,He could not comprehend his own feelings nor the feelings of others; but it is easily understood how a person can be admitted into a house or a family without becoming one of them.
neutral,"Farewell, Anthony."""
neutral,"A medicine was offered to him, which he was obliged to take: a bitter remedy, at which the sick body and the oppressed spirit alike shuddered."
neutral,"Anthony went to Bremen, and there he learnt what poverty and hard living really were."
neutral,"An echo of the past, sounds long vanished."
neutral,The great oaks formed an outline to the scene which he so well remembered in his childhood.
neutral,"Such were Anthony's thoughts as he stood under the tree, and during many a long night as he lay in his lonely chamber in the wooden house in Hauschen Street, Copenhagen, in the foreign land to which the rich merchant of Bremen, his employer, had sent him on condition that he should never marry."
neutral,"Winter one year set in early, and it was freezing hard."
neutral,"He could scarcely reach the water jug that he had placed by his bed, and the last drop was gone."
neutral,"In the little corner, where his bed lay, he was over-shadowed as it were by perpetual night."
neutral,The time passed slowly and painfully.
neutral,"He had no tears to shed, and he felt no pain; no thought of Molly came into his mind."
neutral,"Now and then he felt slight sensations of hunger and thirst; but no one came to him, no one tended him."
neutral,It was the tree which he and Molly had planted together.
neutral,"""Sleep will do me good."
neutral,"In the morning I shall be upon my feet again, strong and well."
neutral,And he slept.
neutral,"The nightcap, however, was not placed on his head in his coffin; he had a clean white one on then."
neutral,Never wish for such a nightcap.
neutral,"It would make your forehead hot, cause your pulse to beat with agitation, and conjure up dreams which would appear realities."
neutral,"That man was the mayor himself, who had already made a comfortable home for his wife and eleven children, by his industry."
neutral,"Is it paralysis, or something dazzling my eyes?"""
neutral,"To every one who afterwards put this cap on his head, came visions and dreams which agitated him not a little."
neutral,"His own history was changed into that of Anthony till it became quite a story, and many stories might be made by others, so we will leave them to relate their own."
neutral,"A WHIPPING TOP and a little ball lay together in a box, among other toys, and the top said to the ball, ""Shall we be married, as we live in the same box?"""
neutral,I am almost engaged to a swallow.
neutral,"The top saw it flying high in the air, like a bird, till it would go quite out of sight."
neutral,"The top still twirled about and hummed, but he continued to think of the ball; and the more he thought of her, the more beautiful she seemed to his fancy."
neutral,Where could he be?
neutral,"""I am made of morocco,"" she said."
neutral,"""There is something going on within there,"" said the other lizard; ""they propped up the top of the hill with four red posts, till cock-crow this morning, so that it is thoroughly aired, and the elfin girls have learnt new dances; there is something."""
neutral,"""I spoke about it to an earth-worm of my acquaintance,"" said a third lizard; ""the earth-worm had just come from the elfin hill, where he has been groping about in the earth day and night."
neutral,"Her feet moved very fast, ""trip, trip;"" good gracious, how she could trip right down to the sea to the night-raven."
neutral,"""Who is to be invited?"" asked the raven."
neutral,"""All the world may come to the great ball, even human beings, if they can only talk in their sleep, or do something after our fashion."
neutral,"""That depends upon wind and weather,"" said the elf king; ""they travel economically."
neutral,"I wanted them to come over to Sweden, but the old man was not inclined to take my advice."
neutral,"Besides this, he wore a bear-skin, and great, warm boots, while his sons went with their throats bare and wore no braces, for they were strong men."
neutral,All behaved themselves properly excepting the two young northern goblins; they put their legs on the table and thought they were all right.
neutral,"""You shall soon see what they can do,"" said the elf king."
neutral,And then he called his youngest daughter to him.
neutral,"""And what can the next daughter do?"" asked the old goblin."
neutral,"""I have learnt everything that is Norwegian,"" said she; ""and I will never marry, unless I can go to Norway."""
neutral,"Then they made speeches and drank toasts, and tipped their glasses, to show that they were empty."
neutral,"""The boys pleased me better,"" said the earth-worm."
neutral,One after the other; that will be capital!
neutral,"They shall represent the unwelcome wooer, whom the lady does not like."
neutral,"Shall it be a tragedy, or a domestic drama?"""
neutral,"Do you know one?"""
neutral,"""Those that are most in favor are from the French, but they are not good for little girls."
neutral,"MR. WAISTCOAT, a lover."
neutral,"We have no curtain, so it has risen already."
neutral,Now I speak as Papa Pipe-head!
neutral,"""Now the Waistcoat's speaking."
neutral,"Mr. Waistcoat undoes himself, and addresses his speech to you, that you may applaud; but leave it alone,- that's considered more genteel."
neutral,"""By no means,"" replied grandpapa."
neutral,"""'Father!'"
neutral,"and the other,"
neutral,A thousand thanks; And now the play is over!'
neutral,"She wears a dress of heavy, rich silk, with large flowers worked on it; and it rustles when she moves."
neutral,"""I wonder why grandmother looks at the withered flower in the old book that way?"
neutral,"Yes, she is smiling at the memory of that day, and many thoughts and recollections of the past; but the handsome young man is gone, and the rose has withered in the old book, and grandmother is sitting there, again an old woman, looking down upon the withered rose in the book."
neutral,Grandmother is dead now.
neutral,"She had been sitting in her arm-chair, telling us a long, beautiful tale; and when it was finished, she said she was tired, and leaned her head back to sleep awhile."
neutral,"From the organ in the church sounded the music and the words of the beautiful psalms, which were written in the old book under the head of the dead one."
neutral,"The moon shone down upon the grave, but the dead was not there; every child could go safely, even at night, and pluck a rose from the tree by the churchyard wall."
neutral,The dead know more than we do who are living.
neutral,"The earth has been heaped on the coffin, and it is earth only that lies within it."
neutral,"He gave himself up entirely to the race, and ran with his house on his back, which was all, of course, very praiseworthy; and therefore he obtained the second prize."""
neutral,"There can be no consideration for you."""
neutral,"""Bring a certificate from the old moor-hen,"" said he, ""that you have slept away half your time in fatherland; then you will be treated with some consideration."""
neutral,"The eighth letter from A is H, and there we have H for hare; therefore I awarded to the hare the first prize."
neutral,"No; there is something else on which more stress should be laid, and which ought not be left unnoticed."
neutral,I mean that which mankind call the beautiful.
neutral,"I have really overtaken more than one hare, when I have been seated on the engine in front of a railway train."
neutral,One can then so easily judge of one's own swiftness.
neutral,"""What is the first prize?"" asked the earthworm, who had overslept the time, and only now came up."
neutral,"Then she went home and planted it, and immediately there grew up a large handsome flower, something like a tulip in appearance, but with its leaves tightly closed as if it were still a bud."
neutral,"She was scarcely half as long as a thumb, and they gave her the name of ""Thumbelina,"" or Tiny, because she was so small."
neutral,"A walnut-shell, elegantly polished, served her for a cradle; her bed was formed of blue violet-leaves, with a rose-leaf for a counterpane."
neutral,"Here the little maiden sat and rowed herself from side to side, with two oars made of white horse-hair."
neutral,"He was uglier even than his mother, and when he saw the pretty little maiden in her elegant bed, he could only cry, ""Croak, croak, croak."""
neutral,"We will place her on one of the water-lily leaves out in the stream; it will be like an island to her, she is so light and small, and then she cannot escape; and, while she is away, we will make haste and prepare the state-room under the marsh, in which you are to live when you are married."""
neutral,"Then the leaf floated down the stream, carrying Tiny far away out of reach of land."
neutral,"Tiny sailed past many towns, and the little birds in the bushes saw her, and sang, ""What a lovely little creature;"" so the leaf swam away with her farther and farther, till it brought her to other lands."
neutral,"The green leaf floated away on the brook, and the butterfly flew with it, for he was fastened to it, and could not get away."
neutral,"She sucked the honey from the flowers for food, and drank the dew from their leaves every morning."
neutral,"Near the wood in which she had been living lay a corn-field, but the corn had been cut a long time; nothing remained but the bare dry stubble standing up out of the frozen ground."
neutral,"Tiny was obliged to sing to him, ""Lady-bird, lady-bird, fly away home,"" and many other pretty songs."
neutral,"Still birds are very high bred."""
neutral,"The mole now stopped up the hole through which the daylight shone, and then accompanied the lady home."
neutral,"He was alive but very weak; he could only open his eyes for a moment to look at Tiny, who stood by holding a piece of decayed wood in her hand, for she had no other lantern."
neutral,"Then at last he had fallen to the earth, and could remember no more, nor how he came to be where she had found him."
neutral,"Very soon the spring time came, and the sun warmed the earth."
neutral,"As soon, as the summer was over, the wedding should take place."
neutral,He is a very handsome mole; the queen herself does not wear more beautiful velvets and furs.
neutral,His kitchen and cellars are quite full.
neutral,"So the wedding-day was fixed, on which the mole was to fetch Tiny away to live with him, deep under the earth, and never again to see the warm sun, because he did not like it."
neutral,Will you go with me?
neutral,"Then we can fly away from the ugly mole and his gloomy rooms,- far away, over the mountains, into warmer countries, where the sun shines more brightly- than here; where it is always summer, and the flowers bloom in greater beauty."
neutral,"Fly now with me, dear little Tiny; you saved my life when I lay frozen in that dark passage."""
neutral,"Here, on the hedges, and by the wayside, grew purple, green, and white grapes; lemons and oranges hung from trees in the woods; and the air was fragrant with myrtles and orange blossoms."
neutral,"Each of them brought Tiny a present; but the best gift was a pair of beautiful wings, which had belonged to a large white fly and they fastened them to Tiny's shoulders, so that she might fly from flower to flower."
neutral,"""You must not be called Tiny any more,"" said the spirit of the flowers to her."
neutral,"Don't you know the announcement that has been made all through the country?"""
neutral,"It was a terrible ordeal, and they had, moreover, made such a fire in the stove, that the room seemed quite red hot."
neutral,"""Yes,"" replied the Princess, ""my father is going to roast young pullets today."""
neutral,"And he turned out his pockets, and flung the wet clay full in the head clerk's face."
neutral,"""I could not have done that; but I shall learn in time."""
neutral,"And accordingly Jack the Dullard was made a king, and received a crown and a wife, and sat upon a throne."
neutral,"This is what I call something."""
neutral,"You may be an upright man, but even as a master you will only be ranked among common men."
neutral,"Then I shall enter the academy, and get instructed in drawing, and be called an architect."
neutral,"But do as you like, I shall not imitate you."
neutral,"Now, you see, this is a little history which will never end; as long as the world exists, there will always be men like these five brothers."
neutral,And what became of them?
neutral,"On the high bank of earth, which formed a dyke on the sea-coast, a poor woman named Margaret wished to build herself a house, so all the imperfect bricks were given to her, and a few whole ones with them; for the eldest brother was a kind-hearted man, although he never achieved anything higher than making bricks."
neutral,"The salt waves sprinkled their white foam over it, but it stood firm, and remained long after he who had given the bricks to build it was dead and buried."
neutral,But how can houses build a house?
neutral,"Now we come to the architect, the third brother, who had been first a carpenter's apprentice, had worn a cap, and served as an errand boy, but afterwards went to the academy, and risen to be an architect, a high and noble gentleman."
neutral,"The youngest- the critic- outlived them all, which was quite right for him."
neutral,"Souls always enter these gates in pairs; so he found himself standing and waiting for admission with another; and who should it be but old dame Margaret, from the house on the dyke!"
neutral,And the old woman curtsied as well as she could; she thought it must be St. Peter himself who spoke to her.
neutral,"""I have done nothing at all in the world that could give me a claim to have these doors open for me,"" she said."
neutral,"There were a few mild days, as your honor, no doubt, knows."
neutral,"I heard them coming, and I also at the same time was conscious of a rush of air and a sound like the roar of heavy artillery."
neutral,"Even if thou couldst return, and at least produce so much, very likely, when made, the brick would be useless, unless done with a good will, which is always something."
neutral,"Thou shalt have permission to stand without the gate and reflect, and repent of thy life on earth; but thou shalt not be admitted here until thou hast performed one good deed of repentance, which will indeed for thee be something."""
neutral,"Oh, what sweet fragrance there was in his chambers! and how clean and beautiful were the walls! for they were the blushing leaves of the rose."
neutral,"He had never before been out at night, but had always slumbered secretly behind the warm rose-leaves."
neutral,"Oh, this would certainly be his death."
neutral,"Here he could plainly hear them say, ""Farewell, farewell;"" and he felt that the rose had been placed on the young man's breast."
neutral,"There lay the beautiful, blooming girl, dreaming of him whom she loved so, and who was now, she supposed, travelling far away over mountain and sea."
neutral,"The dry leaf fell out of his hair upon the counterpane; but he did not notice it, and went to get a little sleep during the early morning hours."
neutral,"Then she awoke, and found it there."
neutral,"The window stood open the whole day, and the little elf could easily have reached the roses, or any of the flowers; but he could not find it in his heart to leave one so afflicted."
neutral,"He seated himself in one of the flowers, and gazed on the poor girl."
neutral,"""Farewell, farewell,"" whispered the little elf."
neutral,"We know it, we know it,"" and the flowers nodded with their heads in a peculiar manner."
neutral,"They placed themselves by the ear of the sleeper, told him dreadful dreams and then flew across his lips, and pricked his tongue with their poisoned spears."
neutral,The bees could not be driven away.
neutral,"Then a man took it up to remove it, and one of the bees stung him in the hand, so that he let the flower-pot fall, and it was broken to pieces."
neutral,"The little one would not grow, for he was only a common snail; but the old people, particularly the mother-snail, declared that she could easily see how he grew; and when the father said he could not perceive it, she begged him to feel the little snail's shell, and he did so, and found that the mother was right."
neutral,"And when they had finished speaking, the old couple crept into their houses, and came out no more; for they slept."
neutral,"He shut the lid and pressed the lock, when away flew the trunk up the chimney with the merchant's son in it, right up into the clouds."
neutral,"So he went back to the wood, seated himself in his trunk, flew up to the roof of the castle, and crept through the window into the princess's room."
neutral,"My mother prefers one that is deep and moral; but my father likes something funny, to make him laugh."""
neutral,"""Will you tell us a story?"" said the queen,- ""one that is instructive and full of deep learning."""
neutral,"The other branches of the family were taken to different places, and our office now is to kindle a light for common people."
neutral,"I am the first in this house, when anything solid or useful is required."
neutral,"My only pleasure is to be made clean and shining after dinner, and to sit in my place and have a little sensible conversation with my neighbors."
neutral,"They all thought this was affectation, and because she did not wish to sing excepting in the parlor, when on the table with the grand people."
neutral,The king said thou to him because he was going to be one of the family.
neutral,"So he went and bought rockets and crackers, and all sorts of fire-works that could be thought of, packed them in his trunk, and flew up with it into the air."
neutral,What a whizzing and popping they made as they went off!
neutral,It was very natural that he should wish to know.
neutral,After this he went back to the forest to rest himself in his trunk.
neutral,She saw the new altar with the painted pictures and the carved angels.
neutral,It was lovely thus to look at the sunshine of heaven.
neutral,"And she looked at the red sun, and she thought about it so deeply, and thought of the little one whom the stork was to bring, and the wife of the drummer was very cheerful, and looked and looked, and wished that the child might have a gleam of sunshine given to it, so that it might at least become like one of the shining angels over the altar."
neutral,"And when she really had the little child in her arms, and held it up to its father, then it was like one of the angels in the church to behold, with hair like gold- the gleam of the setting sun was upon it."
neutral,"Believe the drum, and not what your mother says!"
neutral,And the town repeated what the Fire-drum had said.
neutral,"The whole town, and the Drum too, called him Peter the drummer's boy with the red hair; but his mother kissed his red hair, and called him her golden treasure."
neutral,"He could sing, and he sang like a bird in the woodland."
neutral,"""Don't go home, Peter,"" cried the street boys."
neutral,The town musician was very genteel and fine.
neutral,"""Yes, if he could only march his way up to be a general!"" observed his father; ""but before he can do that, there must be war."""
neutral,He did not care for the nickname.
neutral,"The boy was active, pleasant of speech, and good-humored; that is the best canteen, said his old comrades."
neutral,"The bullets and shells flew over the soldiers' heads, and into their heads- into their bodies and limbs; but still they pressed forward."
neutral,"""There stands the old skeleton still!"" he said."
neutral,"""Peter's far outgrowing the drum,"" he said."
neutral,"""Peter will be greater than I."""
neutral,"""But her hair turned as green as duckweed, and was always having to be colored up."""
neutral,"He had a lofty white forehead, and carried it so high that it seemed to go back into his neck."
neutral,"At home that evening he spoke of travel in the wide world, and of the golden treasure that lay hidden for him in his violin."
neutral,"""Shall I tell you news, Peter?"" she asked when she came home."
neutral,"Burgomaster's Charlotte has engaged herself to the state councillor's son; the betrothal took place yesterday evening."""
neutral,"But his mother persisted in saying ""Yes."""
neutral,"But the song was not done; there were many more verses in it, long verses, the most beautiful verses, the golden treasures of a life."
neutral,"And he sends her money too, and that's very useful to her since she has been a widow."""
neutral,At that time he was saucy and an enthusiast.
neutral,"In its sounds were heard the piping of the thrush and the full clear note of the human voice; therefore the sound brought rapture to every heart, and carried his name triumphant through the land."
neutral,"He nodded at the sleeping-bench, where he had slept as a little boy; but the old Fire-drum he brought out, and dragged it into the middle of the room, and said to it and to his mother: ""My father would have beaten a famous roll this evening."
neutral,"They asked for the finest silk and the most precious gold-cloth; all they got they did away with, and worked at the empty looms till late at night."
neutral,"""I shall send my honest old minister to the weavers,"" thought the emperor."
neutral,"Both swindlers requested him to come near, and asked him if he did not admire the exquisite pattern and the beautiful colours, pointing to the empty looms."
neutral,"""Your Majesty must admire the colours and the pattern."""
neutral,"All his attendants, who were with him, looked and looked, and although they could not see anything more than the others, they said, like the emperor, ""It is very beautiful."""
neutral,"These young trees, which were chosen for their beauty, kept their branches, and were also laid on wagons and drawn by horses out of the forest."
neutral,"We have seen them standing in the middle of a warm room, and adorned with all sorts of beautiful things,- honey cakes, gilded apples, playthings, and many hundreds of wax tapers."""
neutral,"Something better and more beautiful is to come after, or the trees would not be so decked out."
neutral,What can it be?
neutral,"Then came two servants in grand livery, and carried the fir-tree into a large and beautiful apartment."
neutral,"But guessing was of very little use; it made his bark ache, and this pain is as bad for a slender fir-tree, as headache is for us."
neutral,"""What are they doing?"
neutral,"Ivede-Avede, or Humpty Dumpty, who fell down stairs, but soon got up again, and at last married a princess."""
neutral,So the tree was completely hidden from sight as if it had never existed.
neutral,"I shall be sheltered here, I dare say, until spring comes."
neutral,How thoughtful and kind everybody is to me!
neutral,"""I am not old at all,"" replied the tree, ""I only came from the forest this winter, I am now checked in my growth."""
neutral,But would this ever happen?
neutral,"Yes; one morning people came to clear out the garret, the boxes were packed away, and the tree was pulled out of the corner, and thrown roughly on the garret floor; then the servant dragged it out upon the staircase where the daylight shone."
neutral,Fresh and fragrant roses hung over the little palings.
neutral,"Then the children, who were at play, came and seated themselves in front of the fire, and looked at it and cried, ""Pop, pop."""
neutral,"Those who walked outside the town, where the houses were less crowded and interspersed by gardens and little fields, saw the evening sky much better, and heard the sound of the bell much more clearly."
neutral,"It seemed as though the sound came from a church, deep in the calm, fragrant wood, and thither people looked with devout feelings."
neutral,"When people came home they used to say that it had been very romantic, and that really means something else than merely taking tea."
neutral,Now many went out into the wood for the sake of this splendid berth; but only one of them came back with some sort of explanation.
neutral,"None of them had gone far enough, nor had he, and yet he said that the sound of the bell came from a large owl in a hollow tree."
neutral,"It was a wisdom owl, which continually knocked its head against the tree, but he was unable to say with certainty whether its head or the hollow trunk of the tree was the cause of the noise."
neutral,"He was appointed ""Bellringer to the World,"" and wrote every year a short dissertation on the owl, but by this means people did not become any wiser than they had been before."
neutral,The sun shone most brightly; and the sound of the great unknown bell was heard more distinctly than ever.
neutral,"He who spoke was a king's son, and therefore the others said that such a one always wishes to be cleverer than other people."
neutral,"That he had done, and had started again in his wooden shoes and old clothes, for the sound of the bell was too enticing- he felt he must go on."
neutral,"The king's son also received several good scratches, but the sun was shining on his way, and it is he whom we will now follow, for he was a quick fellow."
neutral,"""Shall we thrash him?"
neutral,"There grew magnificent oaks and beech-trees; and if the bark was split of any of them, long blades of grass grew out of the clefts; there were also large smooth lakes in the wood, on which the swans were swimming about and flapping their wings."
neutral,Yet I may perhaps see the round sun once more before he disappears beneath the horizon.
neutral,"I will climb up these rocks, they are as high as the highest trees!"""
neutral,"It is different with the tree; it is obliged to keep awake through three seasons of the year, and does not get any sleep till winter comes."
neutral,"It must be quite melancholy."""
neutral,"The oak remained awake through the morning of spring, the noon of summer, and the evening of autumn; its time of rest, its night drew nigh- winter was coming."
neutral,"Already the storms were singing, ""Good-night, good-night."""
neutral,"""We will rock you and lull you."
neutral,"Go to sleep, go to sleep."
neutral,"Correctly speaking, you are but a youngster in the world."
neutral,"Its summit towered above all the other trees, and could be seen far out at sea, so that it served as a landmark to the sailors."
neutral,It had no idea how many eyes looked eagerly for it.
neutral,"The summit of the tree waved to and fro, and bent downwards as if in his silent longing he sought for something."
neutral,The birch-tree was the quickest of all.
neutral,"""But the beautiful thyme of last summer, where is that? and the lilies-of-the-valley, which last year covered the earth with their bloom? and the wild apple-tree with its lovely blossoms, and all the glory of the wood, which has flourished year after year? even what may have but now sprouted forth could be with us here."""
neutral,"""In heaven with the Eternal God, it can be imagined, and it is possible,"" sounded the reply through the air."
neutral,The sea rolled in great billows towards the shore.
neutral,"There it lay stretched on the snow-covered shore, and over it sounded the notes of a song from the ship- a song of Christmas joy, and of the redemption of the soul of man, and of eternal life through Christ's atoning blood."
neutral,"""Sing aloud on the happy morn, All is fulfilled, for Christ is born; With songs of joy let us loudly sing, 'Hallelujahs to Christ our King.'"""
neutral,"Then came a peasant woman down the street crying: ""Good jams, cheap!"
neutral,"When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer than seven, dead and with legs stretched out."
neutral,Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high that the eye could scarcely follow it.
neutral,"""How does that shot please you, comrade?"" asked the tailor."
neutral,"""You can certainly throw,"" said the giant, ""but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly."""
neutral,"""Do you think that could be anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow?"
neutral,"Jump as I did, if you can do it."""
neutral,"The giant made the attempt but he could not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so that in this also the tailor kept the upper hand."
neutral,"The little tailor was willing, and followed him."
neutral,"The ambassador remained standing by the sleeper, waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes, and then conveyed to him this proposal."
neutral,"He thought about it for a long time, and at last found good counsel."
neutral,"If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants, he would give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a dowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him."
neutral,"The little tailor, not idle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the tree."
neutral,"Seven at one blow, is my kind of affair."""
neutral,"At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time, and when she thought that he had fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door, and then lay down again."
neutral,"The little tailor, who was only pretending to be asleep, began to cry out in a clear voice: ""Boy, make me the doublet and patch me the pantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over your ears."
neutral,"Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such a village, and must know what had become of the money."
neutral,Then he was to go with him and bring back the stolen money.
neutral,"Soon in came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought leather enough for four pair more."
neutral,"They were so poor, however, that they no longer had daily bread, and did not know how to get food for her."
neutral,"Thou art poor and needy, bring thy child to me, I will take her with me and be her mother, and care for her."""
neutral,"Twelve of these thou mayest open, and behold the glory which is within them, but the thirteenth, to which this little key belongs, is forbidden thee."
neutral,"She called the girl before her, and asked to have the keys of heaven back."
neutral,"When the maiden gave her the bunch, the Virgin looked into her eyes and said, ""Hast thou not opened the thirteenth door also?"""
neutral,"In the autumn she picked up the fallen nuts and leaves, and carried them into the hole."
neutral,"Before long her clothes were all torn, and one bit of them after another fell off her."
neutral,"One day, when the trees were once more clothed in fresh green, the King of the country was hunting in the forest, and followed a roe, and as it had fled into the thicket which shut in this part of the forest, he got off his horse, tore the bushes asunder, and cut himself a path with his sword."
neutral,"Why art thou sitting here in the wilderness?"""
neutral,"After a year or so had passed, the Queen brought a son into the world."
neutral,"Then the Queen again said, ""No, I did not open the forbidden door;"" and the Virgin took the child out of her arms, and away with her to heaven."
neutral,"Then the Virgin let her sink down to earth once more, and took from her likewise her third child."
neutral,"Next morning, when the loss was reported abroad, all the people cried loudly, ""The Queen is a man-eater."
neutral,"There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy."
neutral,"A miller""s boy, who by good luck was standing there, noticed it and pulled it out with a hook, thinking that he had found a great treasure, but when he opened it there lay a pretty boy inside, quite fresh and lively."
neutral,"After some time the King returned to his palace and saw that the prophecy was fulfilled, and the luck-child married to his daughter."
neutral,"The ferryman asked him what his trade was, and what he knew."
neutral,"""I know everything,"" answered he."
neutral,"""I have had a bad dream,"" answered the grandmother, ""so I seized hold of your hair."""
neutral,"""Do not take it ill,"" said she, ""I did it in a dream."""
neutral,The grandmother spoke gently to him until he fell asleep again and snored.
neutral,Then she took hold of the third golden hair and pulled it out.
neutral,"""What the Devil said to your three questions, I suppose you heard?"""
neutral,"""You have what you want,"" said she, ""and now you can go your way."""
neutral,When he came to the ferry-man he was expected to give the promised answer.
neutral,"""There is a ferry-man on the river; let him ferry you over, and you can fill your sacks on the other side."""
neutral,Perhaps he is ferrying still?
neutral,"If he is, it is because no one has taken the oar from him."
neutral,"One winter""s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples, and as she was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the snow."
neutral,"Yes, give me an apple."""
neutral,"And she took the little boy and cut him up, made him into puddings, and put him in the pot."
neutral,"""Oh,"" answered the wife, ""he is gone into the country to his mother""s great uncle; he is going to stay there some time."""
neutral,The bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to sing:
neutral,"""Bird,"" said the shoemaker, ""sing me that song again."""
neutral,The wife went in and fetched the shoes.
neutral,The bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:
neutral,My father grieved when I was gone;
neutral,"now there were only eight at work,"
neutral,"""Nay,"" answered the bird, ""I do not sing twice for nothing; give me that millstone, and I will sing it again."""
neutral,"""My mother killed her little son;"
neutral,"""Well,"" said little Marleen, ""I will go out too and see if the bird will give me anything."""
neutral,"Then he himself went up, and when he saw that she was right, he went to the widow and wooed her, and the wedding was celebrated."
neutral,"The next morning, when the two girls got up, there stood before the man""s daughter milk for her to wash in and wine for her to drink, but before the woman""s daughter stood water to wash herself with and water for drinking."
neutral,"Once, in winter, when everything was frozen as hard as a stone, and hill and vale lay covered with snow, the woman made a frock of paper, called her step-daughter, and said, ""Here, put on this dress and go out into the wood, and fetch me a little basketful of strawberries,---I have a fancy for some."""
neutral,When she got into the wood she saw a small house out of which peeped three dwarfs.
neutral,"She wished them good day, and knocked modestly at the door."
neutral,"But when she was outside, the three little men said to each other, ""What shall we give her as she is so good, and has shared her bread with us?"""
neutral,"Then the ugly daughter laid herself in the bed, and the old woman covered her up over her head."
neutral,"The King suspected no evil, and did not come back again till next morning; and as he talked with his wife and she answered him, with every word a toad leaped out, whereas formerly a piece of gold had fallen out."
neutral,"And as he returned no answer, it said,"
neutral,"Then she went upstairs in the form of the Queen, nursed the baby, shook up its little bed, covered it over, and then swam away again down the gutter in the shape of a duck."
neutral,"She came thus for two nights; on the third, she said to the scullion, ""Go and tell the King to take his sword and swing it three times over me on the threshold."""
neutral,"And when it was christened he said, ""What does a person deserve who drags another out of bed and throws him in the water?"""
neutral,"""Then,"" said the King, ""Thou hast pronounced thine own sentence;"" and he ordered such a barrel to be brought, and the old woman to be put into it with her daughter, and then the top was hammered on, and the barrel rolled down hill until it went into the river."
neutral,1.
neutral,"""The nuts are quite ripe now,"" said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet, ""suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can, before the squirrel takes them all away."""
neutral,"So they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed there till the evening."
neutral,"However, the duck, who slept in the open air in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran close by the inn, soon swam out of their reach."
neutral,HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VIST MR KORBES
neutral,"Another day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together; so Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and harnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the carriage, and away they drove."
neutral,"""All on our way A visit to pay To Mr Korbes, the fox, today."""
neutral,"For we are going a visit to pay To Mr Korbes, the fox, today."""
neutral,3.
neutral,"HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF"
neutral,"And six mice built a little hearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed themselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them."
neutral,"Then said a straw, ""I will lay myself across, and you may pass over upon me."""
neutral,"But as the mice were going over, the straw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in and were drowned."
neutral,What was to be done?
neutral,"Thus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug a grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over her."
neutral,"One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down to rest a while."
neutral,"As soon as she had done this, the frog said, ""Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it."""
neutral,"It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called: ""Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought something back with her for each of you."""
neutral,"Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: ""I have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me."""
neutral,"Truly, this is the way of mankind."
neutral,"She sought her children, but they were nowhere to be found."
neutral,She looked at him on every side and saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly.
neutral,"When the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs, and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to go to a well to drink."
neutral,"The wolf greeted her, and said:"
neutral,"It happened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in her arms and she fell asleep."
neutral,"But God sent two angels from heaven in the shape of white doves, which flew to her twice a day, and carried her food until the seven years were over."
neutral,"Scarcely were the words out of the boy""s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for."
neutral,"Then the king""s son wished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more beautiful than any painter could have painted her."
neutral,"As she did not seem quite willing, and as they could not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be changed into a beautiful pink, and took her with him."
neutral,"Then he went away to his own country, and the poodle had to run after him."
neutral,"He went to the tower in which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for a ladder which would reach up to the very top."
neutral,"Then he descended again, and went to his father, and caused himself to be announced as a strange huntsman, and asked if he could offer him service."
neutral,"But the king insisted on it, and said: ""You shall sit by me,"" until he did it."
neutral,"Then the son said: ""Now will I show her to you in her own form,"" and wished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so beautiful that no painter could have made her look more so."
neutral,"One day he said to her: ""Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall make us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any other, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow."" the woman also liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head hanging down as if it were eating."
neutral,"Then the woman served up four different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine."
neutral,"The peasant answered: ""I have a soothsayer inside it."""
neutral,"Two kings"" sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their fortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so that they could not return home again."
neutral,"And as the dwarf came to the brink of it, he saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they dived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom."
neutral,"It was to choose out the youngest and the best of the king""s three daughters."
neutral,"When he was outside in the field, he took him out again, and set him in a freshly-cut furrow."
neutral,"The youth was silent, but led his horses to the stable, gave them some oats and hay, and all that they wanted."
neutral,"Then she said, ""Yes,"" and brought in two immense dishes full of food, which would have been enough to satisfy herself and her husband for a week."
neutral,"The youth, however, ate the whole of it himself, and asked if she had nothing more to set before him."
neutral,"""At length come a few crumbs,"" said he, and ate all there was, but it was still not sufficient to appease his hunger."
neutral,"So he went away, and gave out that he was a smith""s apprentice."
neutral,"He arrived at a village, wherein lived a smith who was a greedy fellow, who never did a kindness to any one, but wanted everything for himself."
neutral,The youth went into the smithy and asked if he needed a journeyman.
neutral,"Next morning, the strange journeyman was to begin to work, but when the master brought the glowing bar, and the youth struck his first blow, the iron flew asunder, and the anvil sank so deep into the earth, that there was no bringing it out again."
neutral,"Then he sought out the thickest iron bar in the smithy for himself, took it as a stick in his hand and went onwards."
neutral,"At length he arose from the feathers, but first he got himself two bushels of peas from the loft, made himself some broth with them, ate it at his leisure, and when that was done, went and harnessed the horses, and drove into the wood."
neutral,"""No,"" said he, ""I will not be a bailiff, I am head-servant, and will remain so, but I will administer that which we agreed on."""
neutral,"So the bailiff cried, ""Sh-sh,"" and pretended to frighten the hens away."
neutral,"The clerks met together and advised him to send the head-servant to the haunted mill to grind corn by night, for from thence as yet no man had ever returned in the morning alive."
neutral,"When the miller had got up, he wanted to look after him, and wondered if he were still alive."
neutral,"But he said, ""Money, I will not have, I have enough of it."""
neutral,"Then he opened the window to get some fresh air, but before he was aware, the head-servant had given him such a kick that he flew through the window out into the air, and so far away that no one ever saw him again."
neutral,"""O man of the sea!"
neutral,"My wife Ilsabill Will have her own will, And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!"""
neutral,"Then the fish came swimming to him, and said, ""Well, what is her will?"
neutral,"And there was a parlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there was a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and there was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens."
neutral,"""Go home, then,"" said the fish; ""she is standing at the gate of it already."""
neutral,"""Perhaps we may,"" said the wife; ""but let us sleep upon it, before we make up our minds to that."""
neutral,"He soon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he went as near as he could to the water""s brink, and said:"
neutral,"And before her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went up to her and said, ""Wife, are you emperor?"""
neutral,"""Yes,"" said she, ""I am emperor."""
neutral,"I will be pope next."""
neutral,So the fisherman went.
neutral,"But when he came to the shore the wind was raging and the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the ships were in trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows."
neutral,"""O man of the sea!"
neutral,"""Ah!"" said the fisherman, ""my wife wants to be pope."""
neutral,"And on each side of her were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as large as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no larger than a small rushlight."
neutral,"""Ha!"" thought she, as she woke up and looked at it through the window, ""after all I cannot prevent the sun rising."""
neutral,Hearken to me!
neutral,"Then, when the bird came home and had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following morning: and that was really a very delightful life."
neutral,"There was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test."
neutral,"Do you sleep or do you wake?"""
neutral,"""Certainly, young sir."""
neutral,"Soon afterwards there was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs Fox."
neutral,"Gretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket."
neutral,Then they all set out together on the way to the forest.
neutral,"When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again."
neutral,"Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill."
neutral,"When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away."""
neutral,"Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller than the time before."
neutral,and went on eating without disturbing themselves.
neutral,"No harm shall happen to you."""
neutral,"There was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two daughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was her own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated, because she was her stepdaughter."
neutral,"""Here in the kitchen, I am warming myself,"" cried the second drop of blood."
neutral,"It befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and saw the flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him, and laid it away in his chest."
neutral,"""If that be all,"" said the first, ""it must be black and white, like the cloth which is called pepper and salt."""
neutral,"The tailor felt in his pockets, and reached him a handful; they were, however, not nuts, but pebbles."
neutral,"Now she could not say another word against the wedding because she had given a promise before every one, and the King ordered a carriage to be brought in which she was to drive to church with the tailor, and there she was to be married."
neutral,"A civil, adroit tailor""s apprentice once went out travelling, and came into a great forest, and, as he did not know the way, he lost himself."
neutral,It guided him to a small hut that was woven together of reeds and rushes.
neutral,"For a long time it was uncertain which of the two would gain the victory; at length the stag thrust his horns into his adversary""s body, whereupon the bull fell to the earth with a terrific roar, and was thoroughly despatched by a few strokes from the stag."
neutral,"He had not much time to collect his thoughts, for it went in a swift race over stock and stone, mountain and valley, wood and meadow."
neutral,"The tailor, more dead than alive, required a longer time than that to come to himself."
neutral,"When he had in some degree recovered, the stag, which had remained standing by him, pushed its horns with such force against a door which was in the rock, that it sprang open."
neutral,"When it was once more firm, and the tailor looked round, he found himself in a hall which in size resembled the former."
neutral,"Seat thyself, and listen to the story of my life:"
neutral,"""I am the daughter of a rich count."
neutral,"So it came to pass one evening that a stranger came riding to our castle, and, under pretext of not being able to get on to the next place, begged for shelter for the night."
neutral,"We granted his request with ready courtesy, and he entertained us in the most agreeable manner during supper by conversation intermingled with stories."
neutral,"Instead of answering me, he began to laugh loudly."
neutral,"I fell to the ground, and the stranger muttered some words which deprived me of consciousness."
neutral,"After this, the maiden and the tailor returned to the cave beneath the earth, and had the vessels which were filled with smoke carried up by the stone."
neutral,"Begin by learning some craft or another, and see how you can get on."""
neutral,"When they had got on some way they came to four crossways, each leading to a different country."
neutral,"The second brother also met a man, who, when he found out what he was setting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow."
neutral,"""I do not know yet,"" said he."
neutral,The youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to do.
neutral,"Then, one day, as they were sitting before the house under a very high tree, the father said, ""I should like to try what each of you can do in this way."""
neutral,"So he looked up, and said to the second son, ""At the top of this tree there is a chaffinch""s nest; tell me how many eggs there are in it."""
neutral,"The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said, ""Five."""
neutral,"The huntsman took up his bow, and at one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished."
neutral,"Then she went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few days they crawled out, and had only a little red streak across their necks, where the tailor had sewn them together."
neutral,"Then he went to the king, and asked for a ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together over the sea, till they came to the right place."
neutral,"It so happened that his road one day led through a thick wood, at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadow, and at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very beautiful young lady by her side looking about them."
neutral,"He has a bird""s heart that brings a piece of gold under his pillow every morning."""
neutral,And they passed on.
neutral,"""I am,"" said he, ""a messenger sent by the king to find the finest salad that grows under the sun."
neutral,"Long after this, a man was making his way through the wood when he heard a raven calling, and he followed the sound of the voice."
neutral,"As it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the garden and mounted the tan-heap to await the raven."
neutral,"He answered, ""I may not and will not either eat or drink."""
neutral,"After that she drew a gold ring, on which her name was engraved, off her finger, and put it upon one of his."
neutral,"When the brother came home, they asked him about the castle of Stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own maps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger."
neutral,"Looking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he called out to them, ""God be with you."""
neutral,"Another told him that he had found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible; and the third had caught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle, and even up the glass mountain."
neutral,Next they came to some fine meadows.
neutral,"But the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder brother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the heart of the mountains."
neutral,"He walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a delightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to himself, as he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a while, and gaze on the lovely scenes around him."
neutral,"When they came to their journey""s end, the youngest son brought his cup to the sick king, that he might drink and be healed."
neutral,"There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance; and, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door of his chamber was left open."
neutral,"Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of the princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all away secretly, taking care not to drink a drop."
neutral,"Then he laid himself down on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if he was fast asleep."
neutral,"That never happened before."""
neutral,"And then he told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him."
neutral,"Then the others followed him, and he pressed on and conquered the enemy."
neutral,"The King had placed sentries at all the gates, and it was not possible to avoid his fate."
neutral,"Whilst he thus gazed before him, he saw a snake creep out of a corner of the vault and approach the dead body."
neutral,"A change had, however, taken place in his wife; after she had been restored to life, it seemed as if all love for her husband had gone out of her heart."
neutral,"I will extol and praise thee so to my father that he will marry me to thee, and make thee the heir to his crown."""
neutral,"He fished up the dead body, and by the help of the three snake-leaves which he carried about with him, and laid on the eyes and mouth, he fortunately brought the young King back to life."
neutral,"He said, ""Why dost thou come back alone?"
neutral,"A certain father had two sons, the elder of who was smart and sensible, and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither learn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said: ""There""s a fellow who will give his father some trouble!"""
neutral,"The younger sat in a corner and listened with the rest of them, and could not imagine what they could mean."
neutral,"It does not make me shudder,"" thought he."
neutral,"Thereupon he rang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed, and fell asleep."
neutral,"Just come back to me early in the morning."""
neutral,"Then he stoked the fire, blew it, and set them all round it to warm themselves."
neutral,"The youth went with the waggoner, and in the evening they arrived at an inn where they wished to pass the night."
neutral,"Likewise in the castle lay great treasures, which were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would then be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough."
neutral,"After a short time, when they had warmed themselves, they said: ""Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?"""
neutral,"They placed the coffin on the ground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay therein."
neutral,"She went out to the stream which flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons brought to her."
neutral,"Then he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it to the king."
neutral,"As she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, ""What are you seeking for?"""
neutral,"""I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,"" answered she."
neutral,"It chanced that once as they were going through the forest, the wolf said, ""Red-fox, get me something to eat, or else I will eat thee thyself."""
neutral,"Then the fox answered, ""I know a farm-yard where there are two young lambs; if thou art inclined, we will fetch one of them."""
neutral,"Next day they again went into the country, and the greedy wolf once more said, ""Red-fox, get me something to eat, or I will eat thee thyself."""
neutral,"""I am willing,"" said the fox, and showed him the by-paths and ways by which at length they reached the cellar."
neutral,"""Don""t eat too much!"""
neutral,"There was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was Catherine, and they had not long been married."
neutral,The beer ran into the jug and Catherine stood looking on.
neutral,At noon Frederick came home.
neutral,"""Now, wife,"" cried he, ""what have you for dinner?"""
neutral,"""No, Frederick,"" said she, ""that I never will."""
neutral,"Presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there was a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees on each side as they passed."
neutral,"At last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to eat."
neutral,"Frederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off into the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and when it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there."
neutral,"Hans, however, went with them, and when it was night they came to a cave in which they lay down to sleep."
neutral,"One played the bassoon, the other the fiddle, and the third put the trumpet to his lips, and blew out his cheeks as much as he possibly could."
neutral,"I have never done that yet."""
neutral,The cat asked him if he would like to see her horses?
neutral,"""It will follow me in three days"" time."""
neutral,"She asked the miller where the miller""s boy and drudge was?"
neutral,"""And that is for the third miller""s boy,"" said she."
neutral,"When he got into the room, the king""s daughter said: ""Take your cap off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence."""
neutral,"Perhaps the unknown man will show himself."""
neutral,They rode back and announced this to the king.
neutral,"The Lord answered, ""I only ask for a night""s lodging."""
neutral,He had hardly done so when the poor man opened the little door and bade the traveler come in.
neutral,"But the Lord was unwilling to take their bed from the two old folks; however, they would not be satisfied, until at length he did it and lay down in their bed, while they themselves lay on some straw on the ground."
neutral,"When the sun shone in through the little window, and the Lord had got up, he again ate with them, and then prepared to set out on his journey."
neutral,"The sun was high when the rich man got up and leaned out of his window and saw, on the opposite side of the way, a new clean-looking house with red tiles and bright windows where the old hut used to be."
neutral,"""Quick!"" said his wife, ""get on your horse."
neutral,"""Yes,"" said the Lord; ""if I ever come back again, I will do so."""
neutral,"He patted its neck, and said, ""Gently, Lisa,"" but the horse only began new tricks."
neutral,And thus was his first wish fulfilled.
neutral,"But I will manage so that there is nothing at all left me to wish for afterwards."""
neutral,"So she went to the sun and said, ""Thou shinest everywhere, on the hill""s top and the valley""s depth--hast thou anywhere seen my white dove?"""
neutral,"""No,"" said the sun, ""I have not seen it; but I will give thee a casket--open it when thy hour of need comes."""
neutral,"The princess asked what she meant, and she said, ""Let me speak with the bridegroom this night in his chamber, and I will give thee the dress."""
neutral,"At last the princess agreed, but she told her chamberlain to give the prince a sleeping draught, that he might not hear or see her."
neutral,"When evening came, and the prince had fallen asleep, she was led into his chamber, and she sat herself down at his feet, and said: ""I have followed thee seven years."
neutral,"The brother did not drink, although he was so thirsty, but said, ""I will wait for the next spring."""
neutral,"But at last the girl said, ""Be quiet, dear little roe, I will never, never leave you."""
neutral,"And when they had gone a very long way they came at last to a little house, and the girl looked in; and as it was empty, she thought, ""We can stay here and live."""
neutral,"""But,"" said she to him, ""come back to me in the evening; I must shut my door for fear of the rough huntsmen, so knock and say, ""My little sister, let me in!"" that I may know you; and if you do not say that, I shall not open the door."""
neutral,"This went on for the whole day, but at last by the evening the huntsmen had surrounded him, and one of them wounded him a little in the foot, so that he limped and ran slowly."
neutral,"Then a hunter crept after him to the cottage and heard how he said, ""My little sister, let me in,"" and saw that the door was opened for him, and was shut again at once."
neutral,"And when he again heard the sport outside, he said, ""I cannot bear it, I must be there; they shall not find it so easy to catch me."""
neutral,"As soon as the sun had set, the King said to the huntsman, ""Now come and show me the cottage in the wood;"" and when he was at the door, he knocked and called out, ""Dear little sister, let me in."""
neutral,"The King took the lovely maiden upon his horse and carried her to his palace, where the wedding was held with great pomp."
neutral,"The daughter also was close by; so they carried the weakly Queen into the bath-room, and put her into the bath; then they shut the door and ran away."
neutral,"Twice shall I come, then never more."""
neutral,"The daughter was taken into the forest where she was torn to pieces by wild beasts, but the witch was cast into the fire and miserably burnt."
neutral,"The Lord had commanded him to let no one in during his absence, so Peter stood by the door and kept watch."
neutral,"""Little scraps which fall off the table of their own accord are not stolen, and are not worth speaking about."
neutral,"Saint Peter let himself be moved by pity, and opened the door of heaven just wide enough for the lame tailor to slip his lean body in."
neutral,"When the Lord and master came back again with his heavenly companions, he did not see the tailor behind the door, but when he seated himself on his chair the footstool was missing."
neutral,"Henceforth thou canst stay no longer in heaven, but must go outside the door again."
neutral,"She killed two fowls, scalded them, plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before the fire, that they might roast."
neutral,"So she took another hearty drink, and let the second chicken follow the first."
neutral,"""When the hounds are following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself."""
neutral,"Her betrothed only replied, ""You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already invited guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I will strew ashes along the path."""
neutral,"She stepped inside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned throughout."
neutral,Again it cried:
neutral,"""Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair, Linger not in this murderers"" lair."""
neutral,"""Keep as still as a mouse,"" she said; ""do not move or speak, or it will be all over with you."
neutral,"Tonight, when the robbers are all asleep, we will flee together."
neutral,"All night long they walked, and it was morning before they reached the mill."
neutral,"""And you, my love,"" said the bridegroom, turning to her, ""is there no tale you know?"
neutral,"Tell us something."""
neutral,"""I went alone through a forest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within, but a bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:"
neutral,"""I went on through the house from room to room, but they were all empty, and everything was so grim and mysterious."
neutral,"At last I went down to the cellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head still."
neutral,Dobbin!
neutral,"Then up he sprang, and moved off, dragging the lion behind him."
neutral,"Then a little cart passed by and said, ""Why art thou sweeping, little broom?"""
neutral,"""Have I not reason to burn?"""
neutral,"The mother of Hans said: ""Whither away, Hans?"""
neutral,"""Oh, I""ll behave well."
neutral,Hans comes to Gretel.
neutral,"Hans takes the needle, sticks it into a hay-cart, and follows the cart home."
neutral,"Where have you been?"""
neutral,"Goodbye, mother."""
neutral,"Hans takes the knife, sticks it in his sleeve, and goes home."
neutral,"""Good evening, Hans."
neutral,"""What did Gretel give you?"""
neutral,"""To Gretel, mother."""
neutral,"Goodbye, mother."""
neutral,Hans comes to Gretel.
neutral,"""What did Gretel give you?"""
neutral,"""Put it in my pocket."""
neutral,"""Goodbye, Hans."""
neutral,"""With Gretel."""
neutral,"""Where is the bacon, Hans?"""
neutral,"""Whither away, Hans?"""
neutral,"""To Gretel, mother."""
neutral,"""I""ll behave well."
neutral,"Goodbye, mother."""
neutral,"""Good evening, mother."""
neutral,"There was once a King""s son who was seized with a desire to travel about the world, and took no one with him but a faithful servant."
neutral,"""Take a seat and rest yourselves."""
neutral,She blew up the fire on which she was cooking something in a small pot.
neutral,"Whilst she fetched it, the King""s son rode away, and the servant who had to buckle his saddle tight, was the only one present when the wicked witch came with the drink."
neutral,"""Take that to your master,"" said she."
neutral,"""Who knows whether we shall find anything better to-day?"" said the servant; so he killed the raven, and took it with him."
neutral,"And now they journeyed onwards into the forest the whole day, but could not get out of it."
neutral,"Hardly, however, had they swallowed a couple of mouthfuls, before they all fell down dead, for the raven had communicated to them the poison from the horse-flesh."
neutral,"But the King""s son said she might keep everything, he would have none of it, and rode onwards with his servant."
neutral,Then he went to her and laid his riddle before her.
neutral,"And when she thought that he was asleep and dreaming, she spoke to him, and hoped that he would answer in his sleep, as many do, but he was awake, and understood and heard everything quite well."
neutral,"Then were the three mantles brought thither by the servant, and when the judges saw the misty-grey one which the King""s daughter usually wore, they said, ""Let the mantle be embroidered with gold and silver, and then it will be your wedding-mantle."
neutral,"""If you would do me any good I would willingly tell you,"" said the merchant."
neutral,"The boy one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for some time; at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it, sold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the twelve years were coming round when he must keep his word."
neutral,"""Fair and softly,"" said the little old man; ""right is right; I have paid my money, and your father has had it, and spent it; so be so good as to let me have what I paid it for."""
neutral,"Heinel agreed that his father must give him up, and that so far the dwarf should have his way: but, on the other hand, the fairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him, if he followed his own course; and he did not choose to be given up to his hump-backed friend, who seemed so anxious for his company."
neutral,"This night twelve men will come: their faces will be black, and they will be dressed in chain armour."
neutral,"Then he said he would do what she asked, and put the ring on his finger, and wished himself near the town where his father lived."
neutral,"The king, however, still vowed that he was his son, and said, ""Is there no mark by which you would know me if I am really your son?"""
neutral,"Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy""s head whenever the wearer gave the words, ""Heads off!""; a cloak that made the owner invisible, or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair of boots that carried the wearer wherever he wished."
neutral,"So they gave it him, charging him to try it on a tree."
neutral,"Ought he to have had such treatment from thee?"""
neutral,"The father said: ""If it be possible, your desire shall be fulfilled,"" and he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom, until eleven young maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face, figure, and size."
neutral,"And next morning when the king had his twelve huntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once looked at the spinning-wheels."
neutral,"An aged count once lived in Switzerland, who had an only son, but he was stupid, and could learn nothing."
neutral,"At the end of this time, he came home again, and his father asked: ""Now, my son, what have you learnt?"""
neutral,"""Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark."""
neutral,"When he came back the father again asked: ""My son, what have you learnt?"""
neutral,"As he himself would have it so, they gave him some food for the wild animals, and led him down to the tower."
neutral,"They are bewitched, and are obliged to watch over a great treasure which is below in the tower, and they can have no rest until it is taken away, and I have likewise learnt, from their discourse, how that is to be done."""
neutral,"These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs."
neutral,Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun.
neutral,"They agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the old woman came by day."
neutral,"""Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down your hair to me."""
neutral,"So he shot his arrow at the fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and ran into the wood."
neutral,"However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would not rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard the same good counsel."
neutral,"So he sat down, and the fox began to run, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair whistled in the wind."
neutral,"In the morning came the fox again and met him as he was beginning his journey, and said, ""Go straight forward, till you come to a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and snoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and on till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage; close by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the bird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise you will repent it."""
neutral,"Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the young man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the wind."
neutral,"Then he was brought before the king, and the king said, ""You shall never have my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops the view from my window."""
neutral,"When you come to the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must say, ""Here she is!"""
neutral,"Then lift her quickly on to the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side, and gallop away as fast as you can."""
neutral,"All went right: then the fox said, ""When you come to the castle where the bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will ride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right horse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that you want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and when you get it into your hand, ride away."""
neutral,"He rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where he had left his two brothers."
neutral,"And when harvest time came, the apples on this tree were all as red as blood."
neutral,"Then the King""s youngest child had a great desire for an apple, and said to her sisters, ""Our father loves us far too much to wish us underground, it is my belief that he would only do that to people who were strangers."""
neutral,"Hereupon so many young men went about the country in search, that there was no counting them, for every one loved the three children because they were so kind to all, and so fair of face."
neutral,"Then he showed him a deep well, but there was no water in it."
neutral,"When he had gone down for a short distance, he rang, and they at once drew him up again."
neutral,"So he took a great stone which was lying there, and placed it in the basket, and when it was about half way up, his false brothers above cut the rope, so that the basket with the stone fell to the ground, and they thought that he was dead, and ran away with the three princesses, making them promise to tell their father that it was they who had delivered them, and then they went to the King, and each demanded a princess in marriage."
neutral,"When he was above ground, he at once went to the King""s palace, just as the wedding of one princess was about to be celebrated, and he went to the room where the King and his three daughters were."
neutral,"And he went out, listened at the door, and heard everything."
neutral,"Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you will do what I wish."""
neutral,"""Tomorrow, you shall only do me a very trifling piece of work."
neutral,"Next day the old woman took him to the well, and let him down in a basket."
neutral,"Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended, the manikin was there with a small cudgel in his hand, and said: ""What does my lord command?"""
neutral,"Then he answered, ""To tell the truth I did not cook it, but Cat-skin did."""
neutral,"But this time she kept away too long, and stayed beyond the half-hour; so she had not time to take off her fine dress, and threw her fur mantle over it, and in her haste did not blacken herself all over with soot, but left one of her fingers white."
neutral,"Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of the most secret things was brought to him through the air."
neutral,No sooner had it touched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices outside his window.
neutral,"He went and listened, and then noticed that it was the sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods."
neutral,"So he cut off her head, and as she was being dressed for the spit, the queen""s ring was found inside her."
neutral,"So the good young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword, and gave it to them for food."
neutral,"So he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it, before his eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the bottom of the sea, and added: ""If you come up again without it you will be thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves."""
neutral,"After he had wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to a wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep."
neutral,"Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them was beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy."
neutral,"Now it chanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the girl stopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang out of her hand and fell into the well."
neutral,"As she entered the courtyard, the cock who was perched on the well, called out:"
neutral,"Once upon a time the little hen went with the little cock to the nut-hill, and they agreed together that whichsoever of them found a kernel of a nut should share it with the other."
neutral,"Then the procession went onwards, and they reached the stream."
neutral,"""How are we to get over?"" said the little cock."
neutral,"Then Gambling Hansel said, ""For my part, you may stay the night, but I cannot give you a bed or anything to eat."""
neutral,On this they would not let him go.
neutral,"Meanwhile St. Peter and the Lord were waiting, and as he was so long in coming, they set out to meet him."
neutral,"""Gambling Hansel."""
neutral,"Then he went to the door of Hell, and there they let him in."
neutral,"But Gambling Hansel instantly began to play again, and there was such a noise and confusion that there was no hearing what they themselves were saying."
neutral,"""Well,"" said the father, ""we will try for once."""
neutral,"It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast, and Tom was calling out, ""Gently! gently!"" two strangers came up."
neutral,"Shall I throw it all out?"""
neutral,"Then Tom called out as loud as he could, ""Very well! hold your hands! here it comes."""
neutral,"I am here, the wolf has swallowed me."""
neutral,[*] Simpleton
neutral,"""Good day, Little Red-Cap,"" said he."
neutral,"Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed and drew the curtains."
neutral,"""The better to hug you with."""
neutral,"Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned."
neutral,"The miller""s house was close by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter."
neutral,"Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great heap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, ""All this must be spun into gold before morning, as you love your life."""
neutral,"Reel away, reel away, Straw into gold!"""
neutral,"""No, madam!"""
neutral,"There she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash."
neutral,"It happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his wife""s daughters what he should bring them."
neutral,"""Now, child,"" said he to his own daughter, ""what will you have?"""
neutral,"Then first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven, chirping and hopping about."
neutral,"And they flew down into the ashes; and the little doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and then the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain into the dishes, and left all the ashes."
neutral,"Then her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold and silver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them on, and followed her sisters to the feast."
neutral,"In this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and Ashputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without being seen."
neutral,"The shoe is too small, and not made for you!"
neutral,"""Back again! back again! look to the shoe!"
neutral,The prince told him to send her.
neutral,Princess! the shoe was made for you!
neutral,"Prince! prince! take home thy bride, For she is the true one that sits by thy side!"""
neutral,"A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth."
neutral,"""Make yourself easy,"" said the wolf, ""I will give you some good advice."
neutral,"Now do you lie down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you that they will take care of you as long as you live."""
neutral,"Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, ""Now, my good fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way when I want to taste one of the old shepherd""s fine fat sheep."""
neutral,"But Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed his locks for him finely."
neutral,"""Well,"" said the sparrow, ""you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak."""
neutral,"So the dog stretched himself out on the road, and fell fast asleep."
neutral,"But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and than all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it."
neutral,"And so the little girl really did grow up; her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and her hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snowdrop."
neutral,"""Tell me, glass, tell me true!"
neutral,"""Tell me, glass, tell me true!"
neutral,"Then she knocked at the door, and cried, ""Fine wares to sell!"""
neutral,"Snowdrop looked out at the window, and said, ""Good day, good woman! what have you to sell?"""
neutral,"Then the young prince said, ""All this shall not frighten me; I will go and see this Briar Rose."""
neutral,"And when he came into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit was standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going to drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be plucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as if she was going to beat the boy."
neutral,"Then the second girl answered from the other side of the hill, and pointed to the one who was on the King""s right hand, ""Hilloa! hilloa!"
neutral,"These, however, were the two ministers."
neutral,"The fisherman, however, fished this one also out of the water, and reared him."
neutral,"Then the King again journeyed forth, and the Queen had a little girl, whom also the false sisters threw into the water."
neutral,"Then again a little bird flew up on high and sang,"
neutral,"In the white lily bloom, Bonny girl, is thy tomb."""
neutral,"Then the old woman took him up on her back and carried him through it, and he sought for a long time, but could not find his father."
neutral,"Take likewise a glass of water out of the fountain, and with these two things go back by the same way."
neutral,"Pick up the wand again from the threshold and take it with you, and when you again pass by the dog, strike him in the face with it, but be sure that you hit him, and then just come back here to me."""
neutral,"But the second son could not settle at home, and took his cross-bow and went a-hunting."
neutral,"When he was tired he took his flute, and made music."
neutral,"""To whom dost thou belong, then?"""
neutral,"""If thou wilt not believe, come with me."""
neutral,Then he gave him a lump of silver as big as his head.
neutral,"After a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he smacked his lips and cried ""Jip!"""
neutral,"""I did not buy it, I gave a pig for it."""
neutral,"""I gave a cow for it."""
neutral,"Once in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest, and the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said: ""Brother wolf, what bird is it that sings so well?"""
neutral,"""That is not done quite as you seem to think,"" said the wolf; ""you must wait until the Queen comes,"" Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in her beak, and the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young ones."
neutral,"So they took stock of the hole where the nest lay, and trotted away."
neutral,"The King and Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw five or six young ones lying there."
neutral,"""Good,"" said the fox, ""but what signal shall we agree upon?"""
neutral,They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground.
neutral,"After he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the roadside and panting as if he were tired."
neutral,"The ass and the dog laid themselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the branches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he should be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to his custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to see that everything was well."
neutral,"And when she had grown up her father said: ""We will get her married."""
neutral,"I will sleep first."""
neutral,"And once when the King had ridden forth to hunt, she took the little shirts and went into the forest, and the ball showed her the way."
neutral,"She walked the whole night long, and next day also without stopping, until she could go no farther for weariness."
neutral,"And when the brothers had said this, the quarter of an hour was over, and they flew out of the window again as swans."
neutral,"The maiden, however, firmly resolved to deliver her brothers, even if it should cost her her life."
neutral,She only shook her head.
neutral,But she did not answer.
neutral,"She, however, sat continually sewing at the shirts, and cared for nothing else."
neutral,"He said, ""She is too pious and good to do anything of that kind; if she were not dumb, and could defend herself, her innocence would come to light."""
neutral,"They embraced and kissed each other, and the Queen went to the King, who was greatly moved, and she began to speak and said, ""Dearest husband, now I may speak and declare to thee that I am innocent, and falsely accused."""
neutral,"She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off."
neutral,"The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very simple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year""s service a penny."
neutral,"""If that""s all,"" said the countryman, ""I will soon bring it down."""
neutral,"Leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law ."
neutral,You ’ re right . Everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . I ’ ll keep you informed .
neutral,Would you mind waiting a while ?
neutral,"Look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . You ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you ?"

neutral,"I'm sorry , sir . What seems to be the trouble ?"
neutral,Where is your store located ?
neutral,"Yes , how do I get to your shop from Chilin ?"
neutral,"Go straight up Zhongshan Road and you will see our sign on your right , after you pass the museum ."
neutral,I'll put all that into the bag for you .
neutral,There is about a 15 - minute wait .
neutral,Just about .
neutral,"Yes , sir , it is ."
neutral,Here you go . I can take care of it here when you are already .
neutral,Do you accept checks ?
neutral,I'm looking for some black pumps to go with my evening gown . Could you show me what you have ?
neutral,"Not to high , maybe an inch or an inch in the half would be the best ."
neutral,Are you OK ?
neutral,Yes . I like Carmen very much . But I don't mind if you want to tell me about this one .
neutral,Did anyone call ?
neutral,I don't think that shade of green will go with my complexion . Do you have any of those skirts in black or tan ?
neutral,I backed into it while I was trying to get into the parking lot .
neutral,Where did you hit it ?
neutral,That's all right .
neutral,"Andrew , this is Linda Chen ."
neutral,"It's in a dungeon , under a castle ."
neutral,How do you find it ?
neutral,Don't get drunk .
neutral,"Hi ! This is John Li , is my car fixed yet ?"
neutral,Is my VCR ready ?
neutral,"No , that's all right . I'll just look for something else ."
neutral,"No , I'll pay for it in cash ."
neutral,"Yes , I need to order a large number of Webster's dictionaries ."
neutral,I'm a little rushed . Is there any quicker way to get there ?
neutral,It's two blocks down the road .
neutral,"Diana's Flowers , Diana Lin's office , may I help you ?"
neutral,What are your rates ?
neutral,Do you think you can fix my computer ?
neutral,I'll give it a try .
neutral,I don't think so . I'm just shaken up a little .
neutral,Maybe I'd better call an ambulance .
neutral,Where would you like to go ?
neutral,Get in and close the door .
neutral,Can you drop me off here ?
neutral,There is no one here by that name .
neutral,That's all right .
neutral,"No , it is not ."
neutral,I'd like a bottle please .
neutral,Tom has gone to lunch .
neutral,"No , but what time do you expect him back ?"
neutral,That's all right .
neutral,I think so .
neutral,"Fine . Let's get on . Oh , no , Judy ! Get off the bus quickly !"
neutral,Why ? Dad ?
neutral,I can't find my keys .

neutral,My car has a problem starting . Could you please take a look at it for me ?
neutral,No sweat . It ’ s a piece of cake .

neutral,Shall we buy ?
neutral,What are you eating ?
neutral,Rice .
neutral,"No , Mary went first last time ."
neutral,"Yeah , let's go Joe's Disco ."

neutral,Just a minute .
neutral,I've already started .
neutral,This afternoon .

neutral,"Of course sir , would you like milk and sugar with that ?"
neutral,He's going too slow .
neutral,Are you going to come home late tonight ?

neutral,Where did this come from ?
neutral,"You do ? OK , fine with me ."
neutral,You gotta have some better deodorant .
neutral,Get in .
neutral,"That'll be eight dollars , please ."
neutral,What about that one over there ?
neutral,Yes . We have socks made of various materials . These socks are of imported wool .
neutral,But I don't speak English at all .

neutral,I wonder if we can change to Channel 5 .

neutral,I prefer TV play to football .
neutral,Ok . Can I try it on ?
neutral,"Certainly , the mirror is right here ."
neutral,May I speak to Peter ?
neutral,Who's calling ?
neutral,It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now .
neutral,"Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ?"
neutral,"Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education ."
neutral,I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ?
neutral,Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
neutral,"Dad , it's raining outside ."
neutral,Not just today . Go exercise everyday !
neutral,A basketball match between Chinese team and American team .
neutral,"Peter , where are you going ?"
neutral,I'm going to do some shopping .
neutral,Won't you watch TV ?
neutral,Eat some more .
neutral,It runs every 15 minutes . You must have missed it .
neutral,No . The Museum is the terminal of this bus .
neutral,"Honey , it's good if you spend money to buy more books . But $ 100 dollars a week is enough for you already ."
neutral,For here or to go ?
neutral,"Mom , can I have some ice cream ?"
neutral,"Mom , can I have one more piece of cake ?"
neutral,"Sword , say it ' sword ' ."
neutral,I like red .
neutral,Why not ? Let's draw the outline of an apple with your pencil first .
neutral,"Mom ! I was just picking my nose , and now it's bleeding ."
neutral,Leave it to me . I'll fix it .
neutral,"Mom , I don't feel well ."
neutral,What do you want to be ?
neutral,Sure . Here you go .
neutral,"Well , there are many boys that can play the piano very well , like Jay Chou ."

neutral,So did I .
neutral,"Yes , I do it quite often ."
neutral,What kind of music do you like ?
neutral,I like popular music best .
neutral,Me too .
neutral,May I use your phone ?
neutral,Over there .
neutral,Are there many things online ?
neutral,"Honey , it's almost noon . We have to go home and make lunch for your sister ."
neutral,I am keen on a coat on www.dingding.com . But it requires having an online banking account . Is it necessary ?
neutral,Indeed . Online banking enables you to make on-line shopping .
neutral,Do you know how to get the bank account ?
neutral,So easy .
neutral,Absolutely we need a house here . But what makes me upset is the prices in this city .
neutral,"I really , really want a house , even though it is small like a snail house ."
neutral,Stop burping .
neutral,"This channel has so many advertisements , and it doesn't have any good TV programs ."
neutral,What about this one ? Do you like this program ?
neutral,"Yeah , it's very funny . Have you ever watched it before ?"
neutral,I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ?
neutral,"I know , but ... Hey , Jim's here ! I've been waiting to hear him sing all night ."
neutral,I'll put the song at the front of the list .
neutral,Can you give me a hand with my luggage ?
neutral,"No , mom . I haven't seen it ."
neutral,"Right , then you'd better send an E-mail to tell her ."
neutral,"Well , honey , I can teach you how to plant them if you want to learn ."
neutral,Our dinner is ready .
neutral,"Potatoes , tomatoes and cucumber ."
neutral,Do you feed rabbits ?
neutral,"I didn't buy any of it at all . Most health food are good for you , but don't taste good ."
neutral,Take a guess .
neutral,"Honey , don't tell me that you want a pet dog also ."
neutral,But swimming in the winter is good for your body . Believe me .
neutral,Do you want to play poker ?
neutral,can I see these silk ties ?
neutral,Let me show you .
neutral,What kind of scarf shall I show you ? We have them in all sorts and sizes .
neutral,It depends .
neutral,"Yes , but the offer only lasts this week ."
neutral,Maybe not . Could you buy some while you're out ?
neutral,What other kind of food do you like ?
neutral,I like Indian food as well .
neutral,"Hi , Bob ."
neutral,It should be handwashed with cold water . It's a common sense . Don't you know it ?
neutral,It feels good . Are there cowl-neck pullovers with the same color ? My wife prefers a turtleneck to a V-shaped collar .
neutral,Why ?
neutral,Is that the latest issue of Reader you're reading ?
neutral,"I'm not exactly sure , but it's not that expensive at all ."
neutral,It's the same in my family . The coffee table in my living room is covered with copies of Fashion .
neutral,Please give me a piece of ' New York Daily ' .
neutral,You are late . The last piece has sold out .
neutral,Here you are .
neutral,"No problem . No matter what ’ s wrong with it , I can surely meet your satisfaction ."
neutral,"Yes , I can . To tell you the truth , I ’ m the best nearby ."
neutral,Look at the heels . They are slanting .
neutral,How much does it cost ?
neutral,The jacket is tight in the shoulders and long in the sleeve . What about the price there ?
neutral,I came here to ask for some information .
neutral,Really ? I ’ ll take it then .
neutral,"Good morning . Vane Theater , at your service ."
neutral,Sure . It's to raise money for the homeless .
neutral,What about the performance itself ?
neutral,"Two for the front . One last thing , are there any English subtitles for the show ?"
neutral,"Yes , we have subtitles both in Chinese and English on the big-screen just beside the stage ."
neutral,"If you take good care of it , it will last you quite a number of years ."
neutral,Really ? I ’ ll take it then .
neutral,Could you please pass me the salt ?
neutral,Can I also take the MET to get there ?
neutral,"No , can I trouble you to lend me a hand ?"
neutral,"You're new at this , huh ?"
neutral,How much does it cost ?
neutral,And do you want the glossy or matted finish ?
neutral,You pay when you pick them up . I don't need a deposit for just one roll of film .
neutral,OK .
neutral,"Yes , it is . And develop them as glossy as possible ."
neutral,No problem . Do you need another film ?
neutral,Anything else ?
neutral,What can I do for you ?
neutral,May I have a look at the introduction ?
neutral,"Oh , Dad . Do I have to get up right now ?"
neutral,"Yes , or you'll be late ."
neutral,It went off 30 minutes ago .
neutral,What do you have in mind ?
neutral,Mom . I have to go school shopping . There's only one more week left .
neutral,Half the dough huh . Well . How would you like to earn the other half ?
neutral,"We can't go that way , the road is blocked for the next few days ."
neutral,"Oh , that's right . They're filming a movie up there , aren't they ?"
neutral,I wonder how all the businesses in the area feel about that .
neutral,Sounds good . What about shampoo ? I would like to buy the product that prevents scurf .
neutral,"Yes , it is a new brand ."
neutral,"Use , I want a eye-shadow ."
neutral,What about other brands ?
neutral,How about this one ?
neutral,"Hey , Mom , look what I found !"
neutral,"I did , Mom ."
neutral,I see . What does that include ?
neutral,"It covers all parts and labour , except for normal wear and tear of course ."
neutral,I need something to wash this down . Is there any juice in the fridge ?
neutral,It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day .
neutral,Dad ! I don't have time ! I'll be late for school !
neutral,"Would you like to have some icecream ? I've got a variety of flavors for you to choose from . I've got strawberry , peach , chocolate , coffee , vanilla and praline ."
neutral,You're damn right . I'm not so easily coaxed into doing something that I think is wrong .
neutral,"I want to put my desk over there , but it's too heavy for me to move ."
neutral,How do you put this seat back ? I know there is a lever somewhere .
neutral,What are you doing ?
neutral,"All right , pull over at that service station and I'll dress in the ladies ' room ."
neutral,Remember what happened last time ?
neutral,Are you referring to KC getting her head stuck in the pant leg ?
neutral,"Oh , in that case , sure ! Uh ... what are these long sock-looking things ?"
neutral,Hello . I'd like to have my nails manicured .
neutral,"No , thanks , I'll pass . It looks very tempting though ."
neutral,I thought strawberry cake with cream cheese frosting was your favorite ?
neutral,"Are you ready to order yet , sir ?"
neutral,"Yes , I think so . I ’ d like to have one medium steak , and a bottle of wine ."
neutral,"Mom , are those tattoos on your brows ?"
neutral,I don't see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You'd better stop being so ridiculous .
neutral,"You are fine the way you are . Besides , plastic surgery hurts ."
neutral,"Yes , of course , this one costs 260 yuan ."
neutral,If you think it's expensive . You can look at this one .
neutral,It's difficult to explain . But this one is really cheap .
neutral,Let me see .
neutral,The price is reasonable because the quality is super .
neutral,But the price is too high .
neutral,Maybe sandalwood fan is good .
neutral,Would you show me some ?
neutral,They really smell fragrant . How much is a real sandalwood fan ?
neutral,We have a piece of table clothing to go with it . It is a brocade one with pretty stars .
neutral,This silver vase is a good ornament for the living room .
neutral,You are right .
neutral,OK . Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now .
neutral,Did you ever buy food from the snack stands near our hotel ?
neutral,I got it . I think it's worth trying .
neutral,"Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them ."
neutral,"Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ?"
neutral,Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones .
neutral,At the gym ?
neutral,How did you finally do it ?
neutral,Like snacking ?
neutral,"Good evening , madam . May I help you ?"
neutral,That's exactly what I want . How long does it take ?
neutral,"By the way , could you give me a manicure ? Use a light nail-polish , please ."
neutral,"Turn on the TV , for what ?"
neutral,Right over there .
neutral,Here you go ?
neutral,"If you open up a card , you can save 10 % on all your purchases today ."
neutral,"No problem . We always have this offer , so when ever you decide to , just let us know ."
neutral,Sure .
neutral,I proposed to my wife in your restaurant and I would like the same table if I can .
neutral,It was a little table by the bay windows overlooking the wharf .
neutral,Yes . Why don't you try this one on .
neutral,This one is much better . Can I try on the ring with this necklace ?
neutral,The portions here are man sized . We usually end up taking half of the meal home with us .
neutral,Everything looks so good . Is there anything in particular that you recommend ?
neutral,That sounds really good ! Does it come with a soup ?
neutral,"Soup and bread and salad bar ! I'm telling you , these people know how to keep you coming back !"
neutral,I am hungry . I think I could eat a large by myself .
neutral,"Jeans and a tee shirt , right ?"
neutral,Is this to stay or to go ?
neutral,P-a-r-k-i-n-g m-e-t-e-r .
neutral,"Now , hand me the hammer and those nails , please ."
neutral,"Well , it's straight , but it's upside down I'm afraid ."
neutral,You mean a murder cycle ? Did you know more cyclists die in accidents than motorists ?
neutral,I'll tell you what . You can get a motorcycle on one condition .
neutral,You spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an EMT trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month .
neutral,"After that , we'll let you decide if you still want a murder , I mean motorcycle ."
neutral,Sixty two cars . Oath . Do they know how many casualties yet ?
neutral,I was working in the garage and cut myself with my saw .
neutral,Slow down and tell me your address .
neutral,An ambulance is on its way right now . They should be there any minute . Are you close to him right now ?
neutral,"Yes , he's breathing , but he's not conscious ! Oh , please hurry !"
neutral,"Hello , I am going to the store to buy some fruit ."
neutral,"Yes , I think so . There are some pictures in it . It would be a great pity if they were lost ."
neutral,I've got this important letter to send to Hainan . Can I send it by registered mail ?
neutral,Is it overweight ?
neutral,All right . Here is the money .
neutral,You can keep it until the addressee tells you that the letter has been delivered . It is the proof that you sent the letter if it fails to arrive .
neutral,This nutrition cream is for anti-wrinkling and whitening which is a newcomer brand .
neutral,Excuse me . Can you show me some nail-polish ?
neutral,"In my opinion , orange is very nice ."
neutral,"Yes , sir ?"
neutral,"Could we have the bill , please ?"
neutral,"That's 68 pounds altogether , please ."
neutral,Be careful . The floor is wet .
neutral,Don't tell me that's your lunch ?
neutral,"No , this is just my appetizer ... this is my lunch !"
neutral,"Yes , G stands for General Audiences , PG means Parental Guidance suggested , R is restricted to audiences under 18 and X means explicit content ."
neutral,Do you know a lot about cars ?
neutral,A little bit . I'll take a look if you want me to .
neutral,"Yeah , she's hot . Radiator's leaking . Looks like you were running her pretty hard ."
neutral,You do ?
neutral,What kind of deal ?
neutral,Did you have anything particular in mind ?
neutral,"In my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas ."
neutral,There are various kinds of tea in China . It depends on the taste and effect .
neutral,What's this ? It smells fragrant .
neutral,Certainly . What about moon cake ? It's typical Chinese food .
neutral,"All the moon cakes are generally classified into two styles , Cantonese style and Suzhou style ."
neutral,"I'm sorry - it's my fault . I was filling the bathtub and I left the water running too long , so it overflowed ."
neutral,"Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ?"
neutral,"Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes ."
neutral,It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ?
neutral,I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you .
neutral,How come ?
neutral,"I have no bad habit . I sleep eight hours a day , never eat spicy food , clean the face twice a day and so on . I have done a lot ."
neutral,"I know you have done a lot , but you always sleep very late . Sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy . Sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body , and I think this is your problem ."
neutral,How's your new car ?
neutral,It's just what I want .
neutral,And not expensive either .
neutral,"Yes , they are very fashionable , you see ."
neutral,It's a curio cabinet . The only thing is I don't even own those kinds of little keepsakes .
neutral,Calm down ! Shouting won ’ t help ?
neutral,How can I help you ?
neutral,Do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ?
neutral,Will that be all then ?
neutral,"Yes . I really wanted to do so . I love those handicrafts , especially the paper-cut ."
neutral,"No dogs or cats or any other fur type animal , but other pets are allowed ."
neutral,Have you figured out the costs involved with feeding and caring for it ?
neutral,How about the umbrella ? It's made of wood and paper . It's very beautiful .
neutral,Do you like it ?
neutral,That's still too much . Can you lower the price further ?
neutral,It is about 10 minutes walk .
neutral,Finish your hot chocolate and we will go .
neutral,Are we going to come back here for lunch ?
neutral,Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily .
neutral,"I know , but she is going to miss you something awful . Have I told you how proud I am of you ?"
neutral,Yes . You sure have come a long way in valuing your hard earned dollars .
neutral,I guess you could choose that if you wanted .
neutral,How about its quality ?
neutral,"OK , what is this ?"
neutral,We will go to climb up the hill tomorrow . Let's go to supermarket to buy some food .
neutral,What should we buy ?
neutral,Let me see . We should go to buy some fruit first .
neutral,How about taking a cantaloupe ? It is light and sweet . Children love it .
neutral,That's enough for the kids . Get some drinks .
neutral,How much ? Is it overweight ?
neutral,It is 5 grams overweight . Do you want to send it as an ordinary or registered letter ?
neutral,"Nancy , please turn the TV down ."
neutral,I guess we could go visit once in a while too .
neutral,No problem . Who is it ? Anyone I know ?
neutral,He was on the diving team with me in high school and saved my life one day .
neutral,"You're glad he saved me , huh ?"
neutral,All the fruit are pretty fresh here .
neutral,Take much and you can have them six yuan per kilo .
neutral,"Good afternoon , I want to pick up a new shaver since the old one has retired ."
neutral,"If there's something wrong with it in a week , can I come back to change it ?"
neutral,"Sure . But you must show us the receipt . If something comes up , we'll change it for you ."
neutral,Wait a few minutes and I'll go there with you .
neutral,OK . I'll go and buy some cakes .
neutral,OK . Now I'll put the dishes in the sink .
neutral,That's a lot of work .
neutral,I'll bet you were hungry !
neutral,Yes . I've had one for as long as I can remember .
neutral,I actually like having a curfew . I have an excuse to get to bed on time .
neutral,You are going to be such an adorable father ! Tell me about this school .
neutral,"Tom , it's time for you to take a shower ."
neutral,Alright . But you promise this is the last time .
neutral,"Peter , it's time to get up ."
neutral,"Well , honey , wake up , or you'll be late for school ."
neutral,"Certainly , madam . What kind of coffee do you want to have ?"
neutral,"No , I'm afraid not . Can I sit over there ? There's a table free by the window ."
neutral,It lies in perseverance .
neutral,Can I pay by credit card ?
neutral,"Yes . And can you pack the things up , please ?"
neutral,I have a lot of them .
neutral,Hold on
neutral,That's all right .
neutral,Hello !
neutral,Did you stay up late last night ?
neutral,"No , I couldn't fall asleep last night ."

neutral,I'll do it later .
neutral,"Can I have some cookies first , please ?"
neutral,Here is the wine list .
neutral,What do you recommend ?
neutral,"Well , they are both all right ."
neutral,"Mike , that's no help to me at all . I can't wear both of them at the same time . I want a decision ."
neutral,"But after all , it is your decision , not mine ."
neutral,Yes . You are right .
neutral,"Good afternoon , Miss ."
neutral,Good afternoon . I would like my hair done .
neutral,"One hundred yuan , please ."
neutral,I don't like it . It's outdated .
neutral,"I think that an apartment with two rooms and a kitchen would suit your needs . I can introduce you to a place for rent near your school . The apartment is on the 7th floor , so it is very quiet and suitable for studying ."
neutral,May I help you ?
neutral,How do you want to send it ?
neutral,They are fragile articles . They must be packed in a proper strong box . Your light cardboard box won't do .
neutral,Yes .
neutral,Have you written down your return address ?
neutral,OK . I will send them now .
neutral,You can't send this document ; it is not clear enough to send . The photograph is all right .
neutral,Here you are .
neutral,How long will it take to get to Shanghai .
neutral,I want to mail this package .
neutral,Please put it on the scale . Where are you mailing it to ?
neutral,"25 yuan by air , 13 yuan by sea ."

neutral,I like that one over there . Can you show it to me ?
neutral,I'm trying to decide what to wear to school the first day .
neutral,I'd like to return this radio .
neutral,But I purchased it yesterday .
neutral,"2,200 $ ."
neutral,May I help you ?
neutral,That's fine .
neutral,Sure . Your cash back is $ 13 . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes .
neutral,I really need to lose some weight . I should go on a diet .
neutral,I'm calling 6667777 . Maybe my finger slipped and I touched the wrong number .
neutral,"What is your address , sir ?"
neutral,I live in room 1106 of the Friendship Hotel .
neutral,I'm planning on going to the market soon .
neutral,OK ! Do we need any meat ?
neutral,What else do we need ?
neutral,What can I help you with today ?
neutral,"No , that's it ."
neutral,That's how much this t . v costs .
neutral,That's too expensive for me .
neutral,"Well , it's a fruit with a big nut in it ."
neutral,"No , you peel off the skin and throw out the nut ."
neutral,How much are they ?
neutral,How do I know if it's ripe ?
neutral,"Which of them is the local train , please ?"
neutral,"Better take the subway . It ’ s faster , and more convenient ."
neutral,"I'm not sure , you know I'm not familiar with the city , too ."
neutral,"No , that's too risky ."
neutral,Sure . What time do you want to go ?
neutral,C'mon . We're only switching two days . You can do legs on Friday .
neutral,"But Ernie , we're still missing something . We need someone to play the music !"
neutral,"Oh right ... you know , my friend Eric is a DJ . Maybe he would like to play with us ."
neutral,That's not a bad idea . How much is it ?
neutral,I heard it is only about one hundred twenty dollars a month for 8 lessons .
neutral,No where special . I was just taking a walk .
neutral,"I never thought about that , but you're right . What do you think we should do ?"
neutral,Why ?
neutral,What did you do ?
neutral,Huh ?
neutral,"Yeah , and I need to start improving my health ."
neutral,You don't have to explain . Suit yourself .
neutral,We'll see .
neutral,"May I help you , sir ?"
neutral,How many gallons do you want ?
neutral,Give me a quart of light oil .
neutral,"Yeah , I've been working out a lot ."
neutral,How long have you been lifting weights ?
neutral,For a year and a half .
neutral,I don't think I have the discipline for that .
neutral,How much are they ?
neutral,"The pants are on sale for $ 40 , and the belt is $ 25 ."
neutral,Just save the receipt and we will gladly return or exchange them for you .
neutral,Turn right at the second crossing and then go straight for two blocks .
neutral,"Just go straight along this street , turn left at the first crossing and walk straight ahead about 100 meters . You can ’ t miss it ."
neutral,"It ’ s about 20 minutes ’ walk , I think ."
neutral,"Well , you will get there in about a quarter of an hour if the traffic isn ’ t too heavy ."
neutral,Let's take a break .
neutral,Hmm ... How long will it take to mail things to the USA by air ?
neutral,About 10 days . You can send it express mail if you need it faster . It will only take three or four days .
neutral,"I want to send it by express mail . The faster , the better ."
neutral,"This is the receipt , please keep it . Have a good day ."

neutral,Anything else ?
neutral,By credit .
neutral,I want to find an old music box .
neutral,We have a great selection . What decade are you looking for ?
neutral,"Actually , two of them have dancing figures ."
neutral,"Even if they break down , they're still works of art ."
neutral,I would like to exchange this dress .
neutral,I am looking for a pan .
neutral,"Okay , try this one . It's made of aluminum ."
neutral,"Here you go . Same pan , but with a state-of-the-art , heat-resistant plastic handle ."
neutral,Can you tell me where the produce is ?
neutral,It's in aisle A .
neutral,$ 20 per dozen .
neutral,Splendid . Will there be anything else ?
neutral,"No , the roses will be fine ."
neutral,"Oh yes , and fruits . I love fruits very much ."
neutral,"Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea ."
neutral,Can I take your order ?
neutral,How about anything for dessert like an apple pie or ice cream ?
neutral,What are you calling about today ?
neutral,I would like to reschedule .
neutral,That shouldn't be a problem .
neutral,Can I have it delivered the day after tomorrow ?
neutral,Is 2:30 Okay ?
neutral,Your delivery has been confirmed .
neutral,"Certainly , sir . At what time should we expect you ?"
neutral,"May I have your name , sir , please ?"
neutral,Really ? I like hot food . Can you make a few suggestions ?
neutral,"Sir , your dish will take 5 minutes to prepare . While waiting , would you like anything to drink ?"

neutral,"Peter Kaufman , P-E-T-E-R ( Peter ) , K-A-U-F-M-A-N ( Kaufman ) ."
neutral,Bye-bye .
neutral,Okay .
neutral,Just a minute . Here's your change .
neutral,What do you need to buy ?
neutral,I have absolutely no idea .
neutral,"Yes , because I love yours ."
neutral,Can you help me pick out a gift for my niece ?
neutral,"Why , she's only $ 29.95 ."
neutral,"No , thank you ."
neutral,"Oh , cash will be fine ."
neutral,It's broken .
neutral,"Now , why do you want to exchange it ?"
neutral,It won't play a DVD .
neutral,Pots and pans are right over there .
neutral,Here . Let me give you an application form .
neutral,What are you shopping for ?
neutral,"Hi , I'd like to get your store credit card ."
neutral,What do you think ?
neutral,"Then let's split the difference and I'll give you 60 yuan , OK ?"
neutral,With pleasure . What color do you like ?
neutral,"It costs 275 yuan , Miss ."
neutral,Pardon me . Could you help me ?
neutral,What size do you wear ?
neutral,May I help you ?
neutral,This dress is beautiful . May I try it on ?
neutral,It's already reduced 20 % .
neutral,Yes . Please come this way .
neutral,And we can take out a loan to pay the rest .
neutral,Uh huh ... but we're going to have to cut back on our shopping from now on .
neutral,I think maybe one day you can take part in the walking race .
neutral,I think I'd better take that one you showed me just now . It is better than this one although this one is cheaper .
neutral,All right .
neutral,Here is the money .
neutral,May I show you the gold ones ?
neutral,What is the price for this one ?
neutral,That's quite steep . Can you come down a little bit ?
neutral,We brought the price down only a few days ago . This is definitely a bargain .
neutral,Over here is our gym . We have all the latest equipment .
neutral,"Oh , it is the right time for you purchasing in our clothes shop . We are now having a low price on all our summer apparel ."
neutral,160 yuan .
neutral,I go to the gym every day to keep fit .
neutral,Would you like to rent the house ?
neutral,"Well , I think I'm in better condition now ."
neutral,Would you like to be my guide ?
neutral,Got it .
neutral,You could try shopping at a flea market .
neutral,What's that ? I've never heard of such a thing .
neutral,I was looking at this Kenmore refrigerator .
neutral,"Ah yes , that is a great refrigerator ."
neutral,It's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances .
neutral,"Yes , some exercise is necessary for us ."
neutral,What's wrong with you ?
neutral,Do you think you could finish it in three days ?
neutral,How nice these sunglasses are !
neutral,120 yuan .
neutral,"Yes , the same as the one we have . And we also need some small articles in the office , such as pens , clips , erasers and sticky notes ."
neutral,This one ?
neutral,"No , the one next to it ."
neutral,Are you sure ?
neutral,Good morning ! Can I help you ?
neutral,It's a little bit tight .
neutral,Let me stretch it for you . How is that now ?
neutral,Thirty-five yuan .
neutral,It ’ s still too much . Can ’ t you make it any cheaper than that ?
neutral,They ’ re in the cabinet next to the sink .
neutral,Can I help you ?
neutral,I want to buy a hat .
neutral,"Come here , please ."
neutral,How about this one ?
neutral,Black is not my favorite colour .
neutral,"I'm just browsing , thanks ."
neutral,"Oh , yes . That is a beautiful color . It has been a very popular lipstick this season . I have just two left ."
neutral,"Have you heard about our special promotion this month ? If you purchase at least 200 yuan in any loreal products , you will receive this black hand bag with a sample of blusher , mascara and two shades of eye shadow ."
neutral,"Yes , you could if it's kept intact . But don't you want to get a bigger size ?"
neutral,I ’ m terribly sorry about that . We could take it back and deliver a new one to you early next week . Would that suit you ?
neutral,"Well , I'm hosting a dinner party this weekend . Couldn ’ t you make it any sooner ?"
neutral,Good morning . Venus Real Estate Agency .
neutral,Are you renting it alone or with company ?
neutral,Would Friday morning be alright ?
neutral,"Hmm . . . well , maybe we can buy this one then ."
neutral,"Oh , please do not mention it any more . Last night he did it for the first time ."
neutral,Really ? Was it delicious ?
neutral,It was the first time . You should not be so particular .
neutral,Oh . Who is the artist ?
neutral,"Brad , it's her birthday . Let's get her something really special ."
neutral,Do you mean girly ?
neutral,"Women like that kind of thing , beautiful thoughts that are touching ."
neutral,Yes . This one must fit you .
neutral,"Excuse me , but could I use your bathroom ?"
neutral,Please notice all of our aisles are numbered and classified by signs on the ceiling . That might help you .
neutral,Here is the fish counter . Look at the lobsters and crabs . Shall we have some ?
neutral,"We carry products from three large manufacturers and some imported ones , too . Do you have a specific model in mind ?"
neutral,This one from Sony gives a very sharp picture .
neutral,Sky worth .
neutral,But that's what the ad said .
neutral,"Well , you can't blame them . It's a confusing ad ."
neutral,"Well , as long as I'm here ."
neutral,"Yes , it is . But you have to be careful ."
neutral,Only 350 yuan .
neutral,"Hello . May I speak to Jerry , please ?"
neutral,"You can check it , sir ."

neutral,1336 yuan .
neutral,"I'm sorry , Julia ! I can't get home early this evening ."
neutral,"Hello , Julia ? I can't hear you clearly . I'm afraid the line is out of order . Okay , B , listen ! How about I hang up now and call you back later ?"
neutral,Okay ! Bye !
neutral,What kind of jewellery do you like to have ?
neutral,Eight hundred yuan .
neutral,"I'm sorry , we only sell at fixed prices ."
neutral,"No , it seems too old-fashioned ."
neutral,What about this ?
neutral,Would you show me this brooch ?
neutral,"Yes , I will . But how much is it ?"
neutral,How soon do you want it ?
neutral,Could you deliver it tomorrow ?
neutral,Right ! And I have to finish the report by 5:30 p . m .
neutral,"Hello , what can I do for you ?"
neutral,Here they are .
neutral,Yes . Will you pay by cash or credit card ?
neutral,We want to look at some of your products .
neutral,All right . Anything else ?
neutral,How frequently do you drink ?
neutral,I'm usually drinking all night long . At least 10 drinks .
neutral,Alright .
neutral,"This way please . First , we should clean your face with our clarifying cream . And then we use the massage cream . Next do the massage . I hope that you can feel comfortable ."
neutral,( several minutes later ) Now it's done . Is it satisfactory ?
neutral,"Anything else I can do for you , sir ?"
neutral,We're on our own tonight . Dad's taking mom out .
neutral,Dad and Mom ?
neutral,Yep . They said they're reviving an old tradition .
neutral,You mean this is going to be a regular thing ?
neutral,Really ?
neutral,"Follow me , please ."
neutral,Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
neutral,"Excuse me , do you sell apples ?"
neutral,By weight . 6.0 cents per pound .
neutral,May I help you ?
neutral,"You are right , sir . To prepare it , a Sichuan food chef first fries some chilli until they turn reddish brown , and then puts diced chicken breast meat into the pot with other condiments and peanuts . That's why the dish has a bright colour ."
neutral,What kind of cuisine do you have ?
neutral,"Yes , but I don't know what soup you have ."
neutral,We have beef soup and tomato soup .
neutral,"According to usual practices , we serve dishes first and then soup . If you like we'll bring you some soup first ."
neutral,"Yes , sir , where are you going ?"
neutral,May I help you ?
neutral,"Well , let me see some of each ."
neutral,How would you like your eggs ?
neutral,"Dark , please ."
neutral,One hard-boiled egg with toast and orange juice to follow .
neutral,"Chen Liang , a table for four . And when are you coming ?"
neutral,We may come at 6:30 p . m .
neutral,Tingling is on TV .
neutral,It doesn't seem quite interesting . Would you change the channel ?
neutral,"Yes , I'm sure I've done a lot of house painting in my life . And my mother was very picky . If I got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture , she would get furious . So I learned to be very careful ."
neutral,It's John .
neutral,Do you live in the red house at the end of the road ?
neutral,Do you take your dog for a walk every day ?
neutral,"And I take the dog for a walk every Wednesday , Thursday and Friday ."
neutral,Who takes the dog on Saturday ?
neutral,Do you help with the housework ?
neutral,My mum and my sister do the housework and cooking but I clean my room .
neutral,"Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty ."
neutral,"Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ?"
neutral,"Alright , tell me what you think about this one ."
neutral,Don't you think it's a bit bright ?
neutral,Won't you have some of this ?
neutral,Is he doing very well at school ?
neutral,"What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them ."
neutral,But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past .
neutral,"Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds ."
neutral,What's the reason that people prefer to read this one ?
neutral,I think perhaps the news stories in it are truthful and accurate . It also has a special page about the stock market ; maybe this is the real reason for its popularity . Many people are now speculating in the stock market .
neutral,Nothing .
neutral,What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see .
neutral,You have hit the point . It's really hard for a magazine to be well known to people of various ages and educational backgrounds .
neutral,"Yes , something just opened up ."
neutral,Is this 617-228-2289 ?
neutral,Good . Heather will be back in about 20 minutes . I'll tell her you called .
neutral,Will it possible for me to rent the apartment on a month-by-month basis ?
neutral,How much is the rent ?
neutral,"Sure . It's really very easy . First , mix together an egg , two teaspoons of salt , and two pounds of ground beef . Then , add two ounces of milk . Are you with me ?"
neutral,"OK . Next , put the mixture into a baking pan and bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees ."
neutral,"Yes , I do ."
neutral,It says it's located in the suburbs .
neutral,"Well , this apartment is really a must-see . Will you come with me to look at it this weekend ?"
neutral,"It says it's $ 1600 . But if you share it with another person , that's only $ 800 per month ."
neutral,"Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find the right apartment there ."
neutral,"Good evening , Yanking Restaurant ."
neutral,"For two people . We would like a quiet table , please ."
neutral,This is Mr . William .
neutral,"Can you spell that , please ?"
neutral,Yes . I'll have a room free next week .
neutral,I'd like to reserve a table for three this evening .
neutral,Black .
neutral,800 Yuan a month .
neutral,"Could I have a look at it , please ?"
neutral,I'd like to buy one of these refrigerators . Do I have to pay in cash ?
neutral,"Fine . Will you work out the details , please ?"
neutral,When can I see the one-bedroom apartment ?
neutral,How much is it ?
neutral,"200 Yuan a week , but smoking is not allowed ."
neutral,Would you mind waiting ? I'm on the telephone .
neutral,Are utilities included in the rent ?
neutral,Gas and water are included .
neutral,"Excuse me , How do I get to the Grand hotel ?"
neutral,I like word games .
neutral,"Right ? OK , got it ."
neutral,"Yes , and I have the warranty , too ."
neutral,And here is the menu . I'll come back soon .
neutral,"What's the English for Hongtao , Leitao , Meihua and Fangpian ?"
neutral,Good evening . We want a dinning room with a table for eight .
neutral,My name is James .
neutral,Let's go then .
neutral,Sure . It's a most popular dish .
neutral,We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ?
neutral,How much is it ?
neutral,"Of course , come in ."
neutral,Would you like an appetizer ?
neutral,"No , thank you ."
neutral,Twice cooked spicy pork slices .
neutral,What's the matter with it ?
neutral,How about the tires ?
neutral,Nothing serious . The right one needs some air .
neutral,OK . Do I turn on the lights or do I go straight ?
neutral,And do I take that road ?
neutral,"No , doing it in the long run will make you an acute man ."
neutral,Certainly . I would recommend ' Songshuguiyu ' .
neutral,"Well , it is sweet and sour fried Mandarin fish ."
neutral,"Sorry , I'm not interested in vinegar ."
neutral,So now my bill is £ 24.50 and yours come to £ 23.65 . Is that correct ?
neutral,Good evening . We've a reservation for a table for four . My name is Tim .
neutral,But there is a change in the number of people . There are seven of us . Three of my friends are coming soon .
neutral,I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .
neutral,"Not necessary . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive ."
neutral,And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?
neutral,It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .
neutral,I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .
neutral,I think you'll make it if we don't get stuck in a traffic jam .
neutral,Thank you . How much is the fare ?
neutral,The meter reads 9.15 dollars .
neutral,Thank you .
neutral,"Yes , it's Mr . Brown ."
neutral,Here is the menu .
neutral,Well . There's a beauty contest in Thailand just for fat beauties .
neutral,All the beauties who entered the contest were over 80kg .
neutral,Yes . Go down the main road . You can't miss it .
neutral,How long will it take me to get there ?
neutral,It's only about a five-minute walk .
neutral,Star Hotel . OK .
neutral,About 20 minutes .
neutral,That's 10 dollars .
neutral,What year is it ?
neutral,Highway miles are not as bad as local miles . They do not hurt car as much .
neutral,"Oh , why such a high mileage ?"
neutral,"$ 5,900 ."
neutral,What else should we do now after the floors are done and after the furniture is in ?
neutral,You mean we can't just buy curtains already made ?
neutral,I agree . The colors must be soft and pleasant . You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners .
neutral,"Yes , I am trying to find good movers now . Do you know any ?"
neutral,"Yes , please ."
neutral,Oh ! I see . Can you show me the location of Block I ?
neutral,"There are a total of one hundred and sixty parking spaces on the second and third floor , in which twelve are for visitors and the rest are for residents ."
neutral,How about the price and the bank mortgage ?
neutral,"Please check up the price list . The average unit price is five million Hong Kong dollars . There are eight different banks that will provide a seventy percent mortgage loan . Also , the developer will offer another ten percent mortgage to purchasers ."
neutral,I think you'd better take the No . 16 bus . It can take you right there .
neutral,"Certainly , madam . What kind of coffee would you like ?"
neutral,"Well , we have espresso , cappuccino , latte , skinny latte and Americano ."
neutral,All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?
neutral,"Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee ."
neutral,Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world .
neutral,"No , we don't , especially the elder people . But more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays ."
neutral,Are you new here ?
neutral,Yes .
neutral,Here we are on the train .
neutral,How much is the fare ?
neutral,Could you tell me how to use it ?
neutral,You put it in the slot at the turnstile and then push the turnstile to get into the platform .
neutral,"Oh , I see . By the way , how can I get out of the platform after I get off the train ?"
neutral,I think it's 35 .
neutral,OK . I'll get it for you .
neutral,"Yes , and it comes with a worldwide guarantee ."
neutral,"OK , it will be a new experience for me ."
neutral,"We have a rather comprehensive subway system here . You can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway , especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy ."
neutral,"May I help you , sir ?"
neutral,What color do you want ?
neutral,What size are you ?
neutral,"I'm not sure . Could you measure me , please ?"
neutral,"No , the one next to it ."
neutral,Let's buy some tickets .
neutral,"Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?"
neutral,What would you have ?
neutral,Tsingtao beer ?
neutral,"No , ice will spoil the taste ."
neutral,"Fruit juice , milk or mineral water ?"
neutral,"Yes , I'll have a steak , please ."
neutral,"Rare , please ."
neutral,"Two number 3s , please ."
neutral,For here or to go ?
neutral,"Wait a moment , please ."
neutral,"Good afternoon , sir . Can I help you ?"
neutral,"Anything else , sir ?"
neutral,"Yes , I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else . The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk ."
neutral,Would you please recommend some Chinese wine ?
neutral,"Yes , it is the best of our hotel ."
neutral,"Hello , how are you ? I am Jack ."
neutral,I saw that your Corollas are on sale .
neutral,"Yes , it is really a good deal . $ 1,000 discount . I've never seen a sale as good as this one ."
neutral,How about some Zongzi ?
neutral,What is that ?
neutral,"That sounds appealing . OK , we will have that ."
neutral,"No , it's enough ."
neutral,"We'd like this course for two , please ."
neutral,Yes .
neutral,Have you decided on anything ?
neutral,"No , thank you ."
neutral,Twice cooked spicy pork slices .
neutral,Anything else ?
neutral,"Hello , can I help you ?"
neutral,"Let's check it out . There'll be a $ 45 charge to check it over . If you fix it with us , we'll include the $ 45 into your repair ."
neutral,"Please write down your address and phone number , and sign here ."
neutral,Okay .
neutral,"Yes , my brakes are not working well ."
neutral,The front brake ?
neutral,Toyota Corolla 2002 .
neutral,About half an hour .
neutral,I'll wait .
neutral,"OK . How do you like your steak , do you like it rare , medium or well done ?"
neutral,Do you eat a lot of healthy food ?
neutral,"Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind ."
neutral,"That's right . I could stand to lose a few pounds , too ."
neutral,Fine .
neutral,Could you tell us your specials today ?
neutral,We'll take this steak dinner .
neutral,"Probably , Rose . That must be the job of nutritionists ."
neutral,Maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet .

neutral,The big one or the small one ?
neutral,"It's right next to it , on the right ."
neutral,I really need to get some things before I leave .
neutral,"Yes , but that'll probably take about half an hour . You should just take a cab ."
neutral,Won't that be expensive ?
neutral,$ 60 .
neutral,"Well , that's a bit stiff . Do you have some cheaper ones ?"
neutral,They're in Aisle Two .
neutral,"Yes , I'd like to buy these razors ."
neutral,And also this soup is cold .
neutral,I would like to buy a bottle of cleansing milk.Can you recommend me some kinds ?
neutral,My skin is oily .
neutral,"Generally speaking , Cantonese food is a bit light ; Shanghai food is rather oily ; and Hunan dishes are very spicy , having a strong and hot taste ."
neutral,Sure . Here is the mirror .
neutral,"Mm , they taste delicious . Let's settle the bill ."
neutral,Yes . Let's go Dutch .
neutral,Will that work ?
neutral,What about the cotton one ?

neutral,What about grapes and water melons ?
neutral,Sure .
neutral,"What can I do for you , sir ?"
neutral,"Type ? I don't know , what do you have ?"

neutral,Would you like to swim in the swimming pool or at the beach ?
neutral,( The hair stylist cuts the customer's hair . ) Almost done . I just have to even things up a bit . ( She shows the customer the results . ) Will that do ?
neutral,"Cut it short in the front , but leave it long in the back . Leave just a little over the ears ."
neutral,"I'm planning to buy a bicycle . As you are quite a cycling enthusiast , I wish you might give me some advice ."
neutral,"My purposes are two-fold . On the one hand , I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . On the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends ."
neutral,"Can't be greater . If you ride on bumpy , hilly roads , a mountain bike is what you need . But if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes , you might choose a road bike ."
neutral,"Yes , but it takes a while to find things . It's not organized as carefully as a regular store ."
neutral,Usually a clothes company will send their overstock to an outlet . The prices are very low . But you may find faulty products here too .
neutral,You're looking very well .
neutral,"I like the back best . I am good at freestyle stroke , but I usually use breast stroke as it keeps me from getting tired ."
neutral,Do you have your negatives ?
neutral,What size do you want the prints ?

neutral,"Hmm ... This Rolex ? $ 1,000 ."
neutral,"No , we don't ."
neutral,Oh . I see . Where are your digital watches ?
neutral,I don't like this kind as much . Never mind the stopwatch then . I'll take that other one . Do you take checks ?
neutral,Here you are .
neutral,What's the price of the bread ?
neutral,2.50 Yuan .
neutral,That's $ 60 in all .
neutral,Sure . I strongly advise you to buy a bottle of perfume and a lighter .
neutral,"I think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . All you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . Tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ..."
neutral,I like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
neutral,"This one fits me well but it is too expensive , can you make it a little cheaper ?"
neutral,Certainly without ice . Ice will spoil the taste .
neutral,She's a Persian . She has papers and everything . Not like a street dog .
neutral,"Good evening , sir . What's your pleasure this evening ? Your usual ?"
neutral,Which bus do I have to change ?
neutral,I'm just a beginner . Did my poses make me the butt of jokes ?
neutral,Like this ?
neutral,What should I do with my legs then ?
neutral,Is it close to the subway station ?
neutral,How long is the ride ?
neutral,"Excuse me , but can you tell me the way to the Today Mall ?"
neutral,How long will it take me to get there ?
neutral,"Yes , take philosophy , for instance . What makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? It's not enough only to be formidable . It also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life ."
neutral,"Since summer is coming , I think swimming is a good way for you to do ."
neutral,Really ? Does swimming have other advantages ?
neutral,"That ’ s great . Okay , from now on I would swim three times a week . I hope I can get rid of the weight ."
neutral,That ’ s fine .
neutral,"Well , between $ 350-400 a month ."
neutral,When would you like to move in ?
neutral,How about the end of this month ?
neutral,"Are there any special features that you would like to have , such as , a dishwasher , a balcony , a swimming pool , central air conditionining , etc . ?"
neutral,I would like to have a dishwasher and central air conditioning .
neutral,Yes . It ’ s only 5 minutes walk from the campus .
neutral,Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right .
neutral,"Hi , I'd like to have a beer ."
neutral,I'd like to try a local beer . What would you suggest ?
neutral,"Yes , please . I'd like a gin and tonic ."
neutral,Here's 30 . Keep the change .
neutral,"Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert ."
neutral,"I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said ."
neutral,OK . Would you like me to get you a cab ?
neutral,"Hi , Mark ."
neutral,Is there a laundry room in the basement ?
neutral,Can I sign the lease right now ?
neutral,I am wondering if you do facial care ?
neutral,I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ?
neutral,"I said , ' Do you want me to help you ? '"
neutral,Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there .
neutral,Are you still mad at her now ?
neutral,"To be honest , I ’ m not , and I regret a little what I have done ."
neutral,"Hi , I ’ m Paul . Could you show me the apartment on the first floor ?"
neutral,It ’ s on the other side of this floor .
neutral,"If your pet ruins the apartment walls or carpet we ’ ll keep your pet deposit . If not , we ’ ll return your deposit when you move out . But be careful , we don ’ t allow pet snakes in the apartment ."
neutral,Let me get the keys and we ’ ll go to look at it .
neutral,"Oh , one more thing I forgot . You must let us know two months in advance if you want to stop renting within the contract . Otherwise , you can ’ t get your deposit back ."
neutral,"I hate to complain , but this soup is too salty ."
neutral,Sure . What is it ?
neutral,My car has broken down .
neutral,I have done it . But now I have an urgent appointment to keep . Could you drive me to the subway station ?
neutral,I have difficulty with this form . Will you please explain it to me ?
neutral,There ’ s nobody here by that name .
neutral,Hello ?
neutral,Your teacher has left you not very much homework this weekend .
neutral,Yes .
neutral,OK .
neutral,Can I trouble you for some change ?
neutral,"Yes , I spent so much time sightseeing here . It is already so late now . I am afraid I can't catch the last bus back to downtown ."
neutral,A dozen 30 - cent stamps and 6 envelopes .
neutral,$ 16 . 50 .
neutral,"Hello sir , may I help you ?"
neutral,Sure . Here it is .
neutral,I don't like that one .
neutral,That's nice . How much is it ?
neutral,Do you need any more of these shirts ?
neutral,"Could you change this note for me , please ?"
neutral,"Excuse me , is this the parcel post counter ?"
neutral,"No , it's at counter 1 , right over there ."
neutral,Do you want to send it by air or by regular mail ?
neutral,I'd like to send it by regular mail .
neutral,Here is 200 .
neutral,"Your change , please ."
neutral,Good morning . What can I do for you ?
neutral,Christmas Day is coming . I want to buy several postcards to send to my family and friends . Can you recommend me some ?
neutral,Good morning . I want to post this letter . Can you tell me what the postage is ?
neutral,I think so . Would you mind telling me the postage now ?
neutral,Can I help you ?
neutral,There are so many here.The men with red hats are the porters .
neutral,"Well , it depends how many pieces of luggages you have ."
neutral,"No , enough ."
neutral,I can't forget about this when next time .
neutral,"I know they aren't good for you , but they are cheap , convenient , and fairly tasty ."
neutral,I recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . Maybe we could try that ?
neutral,What do we do first ?
neutral,"White rice , please . None of that healthy brown stuff for me !"
neutral,Hi Michael .
neutral,"Sure , it's over there ."
neutral,Now .
neutral,"Excuse me , but could you give me some change ?"
neutral,I need it for the parking meter .
neutral,"Laura , what are you going to do today ?"
neutral,I'm going to leave around 4 O'clock .
neutral,Let me give you another ten dollars .
neutral,I need the change for the stamp machine .
neutral,"That'll be five yuan forty , please ."
neutral,How about this set ?
neutral,Addison .
neutral,"Well , since it's summer and it looks like you've had quite a bit of sun , I'd recommend our summer special . It's especially suited for individuals with sensitive skin ."
neutral,Is there any cable for the Internet ?
neutral,How much do I need to pay for it ?
neutral,Are there any parking lots for the tenants ?
neutral,Yes . Everything is fine in the apartment . But I know nothing about this area . Could I ask you some questions ?
neutral,Can you tell me the postal code for this building ?
neutral,I ’ ll tell Peter to bring your key to your apartment right away .
neutral,Yes .
neutral,It ’ s on the first floor .
neutral,Here ’ s the master bedroom .
neutral,"Wow , it ’ s nice . What did you say about the rent ?"
neutral,"Yes . It includes electricity , water , gas and cable , but the telephone is extra ."
neutral,Sure .
neutral,May I ask if there's anything wrong with it ?
neutral,"No , it's too expensive for me . I've decided to take some exercises on my own ."
neutral,"Run around the track . In the morning I run for an hour , and in the afternoon I run around the building ."
neutral,What ’ s the matter with it ?
neutral,"Well , there ’ s one more thing . The telephone is dead ."
neutral,I ’ m sorry . There ’ s nothing I can do about that . You ’ Ve got to call the phone company .
neutral,We should take the red line . Let's get the tickets at the automatic vending Machine .
neutral,It's so crowded . All the seats are taken . Let's go there . There is a seat over there .
neutral,Automatics are very simple to drive . The first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
neutral,How ’ s that ?
neutral,Check your petrol situation .
neutral,Are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift ?
neutral,"Hello , can I help you ?"
neutral,How does that feel ?
neutral,"Hello , Frank ."
neutral,"I hate that , either . Did you tell him your feelings ?"
neutral,It's a problem . You'd better move .
neutral,"So , how should we get to the theatre ?"
neutral,"If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?"
neutral,Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .
neutral,We open at lo
neutral,The price is on the tag . How would you like to pay ?
neutral,"Yes , I am after some sugar ."
neutral,"Well , we have some nice sugar ."
neutral,"Sure , follow me ."
neutral,"Yes , maybe I should ."
neutral,Is it faster if I take Highland avenue ?
neutral,There are a mouse and a camera .
neutral,Yes . How much is it to send these things to Shanghai by regular delivery ?
neutral,"I see . Can you weigh them for me , please ?"
neutral,How much should I pay ?
neutral,I want the one with the highest interest rate .
neutral,Sure . When do you want to get it back ?
neutral,No . Forget about it . It's not important .
neutral,"Let me have a look . Oh , the watch ’ s battery is worn down ."
neutral,How much is a battery ?
neutral,About 2 years .
neutral,It fits well . I like it a lot . What do you think ?
neutral,Did you ever talk to him about it ?
neutral,Can I have a black one over there ?
neutral,Excuse me .
neutral,Yes ? How can I help you ?
neutral,Yes . The limit is four per family .
neutral,"Actually , you can only have four ."
neutral,"Yes , ma'am . Whatever you say ."
neutral,Is there any limit ?
neutral,I'm so hungry ! I haven't late eaten all day !
neutral,Last time I wore extra small was when I was in fifth grade .
neutral,"( Weigh herself ) Hey , I lost a kilo in a week with my all-fruit diet . If I keep going , I can wear that dress next month ."
neutral,The girls in this magazine are so slender .
neutral,Last week I was down to 60 kilos . This week I had one donut more . Now I'm up to 62 kilos .
neutral,What about this one ? It sells like hot cakes .
neutral,What mark is it ?
neutral,Can I try this one on ?
neutral,"Well , thin is always "" in "" with the media ."
neutral,You lost me .
neutral,We can be so critical of one another .
neutral,"Let's change the stomach , I mean , the subject.How about some food ?"
neutral,Not yet . I don't know how to fill out the form . What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ?
neutral,"I am looking for a blouse . Can you show me the way , please ?"
neutral,"Yes , I want to buy a suit ."
neutral,This is much better . How much is it ?
neutral,You need to make posters ?
neutral,Did you smell something ? It smells so great .
neutral,It must come from the bakery on the corner.They are baking cookies . Their cookies are very popular in town .
neutral,"Look at the swiss roll over there , they look delicious , too , I am thinking about buying one ."
neutral,I am starting loving this bakery now .
neutral,So who takes care of him then ?
neutral,Your dog is really cute . What's his name ?
neutral,Sure . Where should I put this cup ?
neutral,And those pencils ? What should I do with them ?
neutral,Give it to me . I need to use it .
neutral,You can throw that away . I don't need it anymore .
neutral,The trash is full .
neutral,This one is the latest . How do you like it ?
neutral,Sure .
neutral,"Oh , yeah ! He can sit down , roll over , and even play dead ."
neutral,"See , he's wagging his tail ."
neutral,May I be of any help ?
neutral,What style ?
neutral,Is there anything I can do for you ?
neutral,Could I try it on ?
neutral,"Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway ."
neutral,"Well , madam , the meter was not on at all . You didn't tell me ."
neutral,"Excuse me , Ma ' am . I would like to mail this package door to door via airmail to London . It is a very important package and has to be sent within 3 days ."
neutral,Do I need to include my zip code in the address ?
neutral,"I like to stick to the clean stuff , like vodka , gin , white rum and other clear spirits ."
neutral,Look at the flowers over there . What are they ?
neutral,"They are morning glories . They are cute , aren't they ?"
neutral,"OK , here you are . The fitting room is behind the curtain ."
neutral,"Yes , could you give me some ideas ?"
neutral,"Well , I like the styte , but I don't think the color fits me . Could you bring me a green one ?"
neutral,"Then , I'll wait for you at the car park in 20 minutes ."
neutral,Do you have your member card with you ?
neutral,The dictionary .
neutral,That's not a pencil . That's a pen .
neutral,It's in between the wall and the bed .
neutral,Where are my shoes ?
neutral,This one is too small . Please bring me a bigger one .
neutral,OK .
neutral,What's the brand ?
neutral,This one suits better . I will take it .
neutral,Will the trousers shrink when washed ?
neutral,"OK , Lucy.It ' s your turn.Are you ready ?"
neutral,I really would rather just listen.Isn ' t there anyone else who wants to sing ?
neutral,Who wants to go first ? Lily ?
neutral,Oh ... I mostly just like to listen . You're the groom . Why don't you go first ?
neutral,"I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ?"
neutral,I know it is quite different from Western chess .
neutral,"Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive ."
neutral,"Yup . But , this also means we have to wait to order our food ."
neutral,"Come on . It is worth waiting . Their cheese burgers are really popular . Once you have it , you will love it ."
neutral,"Yup , they have good French fries as well . Not very thick , but crispy enough . You should try them with some mayonnaise sauce . That is the Belgium style . You will love it ."
neutral,"Come on . You just have it once in a while , not every day . It will not harm you ."
neutral,"Hi , is you , John ?"
neutral,Do you feel better now ?
neutral,"It's OK now . Don't worry , John ."
neutral,I like chess better than xiangqi . And you ?
neutral,"Quite right . And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi , the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank . It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance ."
neutral,"Correct ! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king . It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent . They are required to stay in the palace , waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards . Look at the king in chess , he is much more capable ."
neutral,"Yeah , and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards , he has a queen who is the most powerful piece . I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China ."
neutral,"Flip it to channel 9 , will you , Janet ? There's a big basketball game on in a couple of minutes ."
neutral,"Oh , yeah , smarty-pants ? Over my dead body . Now , don't be such a brat and ..."
neutral,"Hey , what's wrong with the TV ?"
neutral,Looks like the TV wins that argument .
neutral,Please wrap it .
neutral,Will it wash well and the color won't fade ?
neutral,It's of good quality .
neutral,Of course . The brand is Bird and it's famous for its quality .
neutral,"Yes , I am looking for a coat ."
neutral,I recommend you this one . It's a very popular kind of coat-the most recent thing .
neutral,"Hold on a second , please ."
neutral,"This is a nice place , but you need to get some furniture ."
neutral,"Yeah . By the way , can I take a shower ?"
neutral,"Sure , but I don't have hot water , yet ."
neutral,"Yeah , I can't cook anything until tomorrow , anyway . Let's go to the restaurant nearby . It's my treat ."
neutral,The house is a little too old .
neutral,But it's quite convenient for you to go to any part of the city . The subway is nearby .
neutral,Hello . Is that Nicholas ?
neutral,When do you have lunch ?
neutral,"Oh , it ’ s time to have lunch now ."
neutral,Sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality .
neutral,But you look quite proficient in using them now .
neutral,"Certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Chinese dinner table ."
neutral,"Oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks ."
neutral,Excuse me . Have you got the time ?
neutral,Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month .
neutral,Be careful.It ' s dangerous to drive fast .
neutral,There's going to be a highway here .
neutral,That's better .
neutral,"I get home pretty late , around midnight ."
neutral,"Gee , I'm sorry . I don't watch TV ."
neutral,"No , the yellow ones ."
neutral,Which one ?
neutral,176 Wooden Street East .
neutral,Help will be there in just a few minutes .
neutral,Have you ever heard the ads say anything bad about their products ?
neutral,I don't understand some things .
neutral,MI stands for Middle Initial .
neutral,What does MM / DD / YY mean ?
neutral,"Always print clearly , and fill in the bubbles completely ."
neutral,"How much is the fare , please ?"
neutral,I thought this bus Went down Park Avenue .
neutral,No . And then I often go Rollerblading .
neutral,Wow ! How often do you exercise like that ?
neutral,Titanic ? That old film ? but I've seen it before !
neutral,How long did it take ?
neutral,Did you give him a nose ?
neutral,Let me help you make one this year .
neutral,What do you need to do ?
neutral,What's that ?
neutral,It's the Automatic Teller Machine .
neutral,Operator . May I help you ?
neutral,"Yes . How do I get an outside line , please ?"
neutral,"Variety shows and talk shows , I think ."
neutral,Sure . You mean this one ?
neutral,"Yes , please . I'm looking for a cotton polo shirt ."
neutral,Any particular colour ?
neutral,"I like the design , but don't particularly care for the colour . Do you have that in other colours , too ?"
neutral,"How much is a stamp to send a letter to France , please ?"
neutral,Three dollars and forty cents .
neutral,"Oh , no ! ! My son needs a bathroom ."
neutral,"Well , there's a department store on Grant Street . There are restrooms in the basement ."
neutral,I can smell you .
neutral,"I will blow my nose sometime for you , and you'll see ."
neutral,I'm going into the bathroom to blow my nose . I'll be right back .
neutral,"No problem . First of all , do you want to get a home computer or a laptop ?"
neutral,"Yes , they generally cost a little more ."
neutral,"If my hard drive crashes , I'll just call you ."
neutral,Exactly what ?
neutral,What's the matter ?
neutral,"No , I always back up my files ."
neutral,"Well , what do you plan to use your computer for ?"
neutral,"Then a PC should be enough . Macintoshes are better for graphics , but they also cost a bit more ."
neutral,I think I'll get some new goggles .
neutral,Sure . We have to have something to lie on while we're catching some rays .
neutral,So are you going to get a new swimsuit ?
neutral,I'll wear that if you'll wear these Speedos .
neutral,Does it come with a modem ?
neutral,How about the monitor ?
neutral,Are you ready ?
neutral,How much was that ?
neutral,It was only about $ 120 for a 13 - inch screen .
neutral,"You're in great shape , Keith . Do you work out at a gym ?"
neutral,"Well , I do aerobics every day after work . And then I play racquetball ."
neutral,"Oh , do you want to play sometime ?"
neutral,But it would save a lot of trouble if you had taken it for a test ride .
neutral,"Excuse me . I will go to Wangfujing , where should I get off ?"
neutral,OK .
neutral,Please get ready .
neutral,Is this where I get off ?
neutral,And would you like anything to drink ?
neutral,"Yes , I'd like a large soda , please ."
neutral,Could you give me some advice on how to bring up my son properly ?
neutral,"Oh , no . I forgot ."
neutral,"Oh , no , you don't ."
neutral,What do you mean ?
neutral,"Yes , there are some on Pine Street ."
neutral,"By the way , there's a barber shop in the shopping center , too ."
neutral,"About two hours out of Los Angeles . Give me the bags , I'll put'em on the bus . Here's your claim tag . Don't lose it.When you get off the bus , give it to me ."
neutral,Think how happy we were . Now this.Things always go wrong .
neutral,"Bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... Darling , it looks elegant on you ! It can't be any cheap stuff . Something around two hundred , I guess ."
neutral,"Then you got a windfall ! Was sixty-five the original price , or did you get a special discount ?"
neutral,"Yeah . I turned around and started to move out . Just then , she yelped behind my back , ' all right , all right ! I may sacrifice a little . Let's fix it sixty-five ! Can't be cheaper . '"
neutral,"Yes , all of us have naps ."
neutral,"Oh , we need an umbrella . The weather is so changeable in that area ."
neutral,What's going on ?
neutral,"Good evening , madam . Can I help you ?"
neutral,Are you a wrestler or a boxer ?
neutral,No.Why ?
neutral,Your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so .
neutral,"Yes , I find jogging does good to me , so I keep on doing it ."
neutral,Okay . The library's beside the baker's . I'd better take back the videos we borrowed last week . They're overdue .
neutral,I'll see you later then .
neutral,Me neither ! Would you like to go in and buy her a gift together ?
neutral,"Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they are actually showing off !"
neutral,"What a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted by Lao She , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spending power either . Teahouses of today all feature a cozy , comfortable environment , and high-quality services , but can easily cost you a good deal — just like a coffee bar ."
neutral,"You lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you to your friends ."
neutral,"Then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you ."
neutral,"Yes , that is today's sale price ."
neutral,I'll take a dozen .
neutral,Is there anything else you'd like to get ?
neutral,"No , the roses will be fine ."
neutral,Please wait a moment . It Will take a few seconds to get through .
neutral,"Yeah . It's of supreme importance that the goblet , table-cloth , and plates should be made shiningly clean , so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable ."
neutral,It seems like a traffic accident .
neutral,"Oh , Sam ! Is this your dog ?"
neutral,Usually cities have greater traffic problems .
neutral,So you have all the news on broadcast ?
neutral,I can't find proper parking space .
neutral,The old man is knocked down by the bicycle .

neutral,I see.The bus doesn't come so often as in cities .
neutral,You're right .
neutral,"I mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems ."
neutral,"The People's Park is located on Nanjing Road , near Limbo road , just on the opposite side of the International Hotel ."

neutral,"True , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time ."
neutral,"Yeah , I have the same feeling . Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . But at a wholesale market , you never know whether what you are buying are of good quality or not ."
neutral,That's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to .
neutral,Can I help you ?
neutral,Right . Like our LPF program . The mortgage size is linked with the amount of savings households have accumulated on their LPF accounts .
neutral,Like you and me !
neutral,"Yes , Mum ."
neutral,Don't make a fuss.The price is rising
neutral,What do you think is the biggest change ?

neutral,"That's true . You know , some husbands and wives don't even live in the same city any more ."
neutral,How can you get that done ?
neutral,What else ?

neutral,We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
neutral,"Not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements ."
neutral,Really ? What's the series about ?
neutral,"Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping ."

neutral,Is it on Xinhua street ?
neutral,"Alright , tell me what you think ."
neutral,Don't you think it ’ s a bit bright ?
neutral,"No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ’ s casual , yet sophisticated ."
neutral,"How about this scarf , these earrings , AMD an anklet ?"
neutral,Do you have it in a larger size ?
neutral,Your daughter will be back soon . I'm going to start making dinner . You can just watch some TV in TV room if you like . We just bought a new TV with a LCD screen . The remote control is on the coffee table next to the armchair .
neutral,"Ok , well , we're going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . Here's the recipe . Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?"
neutral,"Fine . I'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet ."

neutral,"All right , Steven . Do you have a flashlight ?"
neutral,"Yes , I do ."
neutral,You'll see it's black and has burnt smell .
neutral,What's your apartment like ?
neutral,It's a furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus .
neutral,"It's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it ."
neutral,"No , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first 6 months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month ."
neutral,Do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ?

neutral,How about at 6 pm ?
neutral,"Excuse me , bags aren't permitted inside the supermarket ."
neutral,How about these ? They are the current bestsellers .
neutral,Let ’ s also go to the jewelry store to buy a crystal necklace . I want to buy one for you as your birthday present .
neutral,Let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?
neutral,I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
neutral,"Well , let's get a plate of those then ."
neutral,I think I'll have a beer .
neutral,"Ok , shall I flag down the waitress ?"
neutral,"You can buy the bubble wrap here , but you ’ ll have to stand in line over here to post your package ."

neutral,"Alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill ."
neutral,"That's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk ."
neutral,Slide your card through the card ID pad and punch in your PIN .
neutral,Paper or plastic ?
neutral,Pardon me ?
neutral,"Yes , I remember it was inspired by a New York Times best-seller of the same name ."
neutral,"It's very thought-provoking , isn't it ?"
neutral,"Such as fat-free milk , whole-wheat rolls and fish sandwich ."
neutral,But I'm not sure if they're well-rcceived .
neutral,I don't think that will do . How about the one at your back ?
neutral,This one ?
neutral,"Yes , but can you show me the other colour ones ?"
neutral,You've made a good choice.This china tea set is unusual.It was made in Jingdezhen .
neutral,"This one is 5 % off . That one has no reduction , but you can get a free tube of toothpaste with six toothbrushes ."
neutral,"Ok then , let ’ s get the chicken feet ."

neutral,That's it ?
neutral,"Ok , would you like some soup as well ?"
neutral,What ' the matter ?
neutral,"Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy ."
neutral,You bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America .
neutral,Looks can be deceiving .
neutral,Are you homesick ?
neutral,"May I help you , sir ?"
neutral,"Mmm ... to be honest , I ’ d rather go for a pizza ."
neutral,"What is it , dear ?"
neutral,"Well , I need to get some female stuff ."
neutral,You mean stuff like tampons and sanitary napkins ?
neutral,I've been told that Chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . We'd like to take some home . What would you recommend ?

neutral,Yes.It IS one of the Five Mountains .
neutral,What do you think of this flat ?
neutral,It's not really all that good . The bedroom is a little small for us .
neutral,"Small , but it should be enough for our needs . I think ."
neutral,Maybe we could get some new furniture . Better stuff .
neutral,"You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord ."
neutral,"A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more.If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to bake meat . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable ."
neutral,"Are you saying we don ’ t have time to watch our favorite show tonight ? Jane , you know I really don ’ t like our teacher all that much . He gives far too much homework . He criticizes me in front of everyone all the time ."
neutral,"To tell the truth , I don ’ t really like him either . He ’ s kind of boring and not very active . He always looks unhappy too ."
neutral,Do you think we should be talking about him like this behind his back ?
neutral,I absolutely agree . It ’ s getting dark . We should finish our homework now .
neutral,"OK , sir ."
neutral,How much do I owe ?
neutral,190 yuan .
neutral,Here is 200 yuan . The charge is for you .

neutral,They're soft .
neutral,Certainly . What kind of novel did you have in mind ?
neutral,"That's okay . Well , let me think . How about a mystery novel ?"
neutral,"I love science fiction and fantasy , but I've been reading a lot of both lately , so I'd prefer to get something else ."
neutral,All right . I ’ ll call you back later .
neutral,I'm not keen on dessert as a habit . They are fattening .
neutral,Do you have any English newspapers ?
neutral,"We have three kinds of dressings for salad . Italian , French and Thousand Island . Which one would you like ?"

neutral,"Yes , that sounds wonderful ."
neutral,OK . See you then .
neutral,"But wait , wait , will there be food that is not meat ? You know . I'm a vegetarian"

neutral,S :: What size prints would you like ?
neutral,C :: Four by six will do .
neutral,Certainly sir .
neutral,"Cut it short in the front , but leave it long in the back . Leave just a little over the ears ."
neutral,What ’ s the difference ?
neutral,"Well , we ’ Ve got several point-and-shoot cameras.These are all 35mm compact cameras with auto-focus and a built-in flash.We also have these Polaroid cameras ."
neutral,I don ’ t think I ’ ll need a Polaroid.Does this 35mm camera have an automatic flash ?
neutral,"I see . Well , it's nothing spectacular , but it's pretty cheap for an apartment in a decent neighborhood ... O . K . , I think I'll take it ."
neutral,"That's true . During rush hours , taxis are just as quick as buses ."
neutral,"No , from New Zealand , sir . I visited New Zealand and saw lots of overseas people there ."

neutral,Then you call me or Tom first .
neutral,I also expect Cindy to tidy up her own room .
neutral,The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street .
neutral,You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
neutral,What do you mean ? It will help us to relax .
neutral,Yes . My home freezer is not working properly .
neutral,"It keeps running all the time , never stopping . And it makes a strange sound . All the ice cream inside it melted ."
neutral,That's right . I haven't done that yet .

neutral,"Yes , maybe I should ."
neutral,"But I work hard all the time for long hours . Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter ."
neutral,But I'll miss the news . It's important in my business to keep up with events in China .

neutral,"Well , I swim and run every day ."
neutral,"Hi Jane , you look great ."
neutral,Hello . Is Mr . Stewart there ?
neutral,This is Mr . Stewart . Who ’ s this ?
neutral,"I ’ m calling from Bell Canada . We are currently offering a great deal on long distance calling , only $ 17 a month . With this plan you get 500 minutes of long distance calls each month without any additional charges ."
neutral,I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter .
neutral,"So you are watching your weight , aren't you ?"
neutral,I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road . It is very close to your house .
neutral,Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ?
neutral,That's the one .
neutral,Where is that ?
neutral,There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
neutral,Do you have small bills ?
neutral,Can I get the ticket here ?
neutral,What time does the 7:59 get to London ?

neutral,Is that right ?
neutral,"I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States . Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread . Before each course , the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way . We always said “ American way . ” It ’ s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners . What is the Chinese way ?"
neutral,"Right , here you are ."
neutral,"True . When I tell my kids to behaves themselves , they will make a face and slip away ."
neutral,Excuse me . Do you know where I can find the nearest ICCC ?
neutral,"Yes , but it's quite a ways ."
neutral,How do I get there on foot ?
neutral,Tall building ... Which side is the building on ?
neutral,The right side . ICCC should be on the first floor .
neutral,I really don ’ t understand my parents . They always make light of my worries .

neutral,Your BAC exceeds the legal limit .
neutral,The next bus will be here in four minutes .

neutral,"Help you in the kitchen , I don ’ t feel like it ."

neutral,"No , why should I ? I don ’ t feel like it . Besides , I ’ m in such a bad mood ."
neutral,"Hello , May I help you ?"
neutral,That is exactly what we're looking for .
neutral,Why aren't you doing your homework ?

neutral,She has a yellow dress on and red sneakers .
neutral,No . But you mustn ’ t leave it too long . Did you report it the police ?
neutral,"Oh , no . Charlie , where is my purse ?"
neutral,"No , you needn ’ t do that . You ’ d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes ."
neutral,What else I ’ Ve got to do ? Join the army ?
neutral,Can I print it ?
neutral,Excuse me . I ’ m a stranger here and lost my way .
neutral,Sure . Can I get to the central department stall this way ?
neutral,Is it far ?
neutral,It ’ s about fifteen minutes ’ walk . That ’ s all .
neutral,"I ’ m afraid not , Nick . That ’ s the best I can do ."
neutral,"No , I had it when I left school this afternoon ."
neutral,But she can ’ t be home now . She might have gone to the library .

neutral,"Really , what's wrong with it ?"
neutral,Yeah !
neutral,"Excuse me , sir ."

neutral,"I'm not sure if we've got any now.Books of that kind are on this shelf.Well , I'm afraid we've sold out ."
neutral,"Ok , I will ."
neutral,"Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ?"
neutral,How do you like New York city ?
neutral,"No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital ."
neutral,"Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus ."
neutral,Two blocks down the street .
neutral,Excuse me .
neutral,Along Queen's Road ...
neutral,Yes.Then cross the road at the next traffic lights.The Peak Tram is straight ahead.You can't miss it .
neutral,"Straight ahead to the traffic lights , left and then right ."
neutral,Actually it is . Perhaps you haven ’ t noticed the sign .
neutral,"Excuse me , please.Could you tell me how to get to the No . 10 Middle School ?"
neutral,It ’ s only seven o ’ clock . Your watch is fast .
neutral,I could have stayed in bed for another half hour .
neutral,Is this watch yours ?
neutral,Which school is your children in ?
neutral,Let's blow on it .
neutral,"Hi , Dad . Where are you ?"
neutral,We're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax .
neutral,"Well , now we should turn back a few kilometres ."
neutral,"That's $ 38 , sir ."
neutral,Size 38 or 39 .
neutral,"This one is much better , but it is also much more expensive ."
neutral,"First , we're going to change the curtains , then we're going to paint the walls ."
neutral,Pale yellow .
neutral,We're going to put in some new furniture .
neutral,"Is there anything I could help you with , sir ?"
neutral,"This way , please ."

neutral,"No , Thanks.Not today ."
neutral,"Well , if you change your mind , let me know ."
neutral,How much are you asking ?
neutral,10.00 dollars a night .
neutral,You need a babysitter .
neutral,"Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights ."
neutral,I could have Suzy stay at my place .
neutral,Why not ?
neutral,I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .
neutral,I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .
neutral,Yes . I ’ ll have a room free next week .
neutral,What do you charge ?
neutral,Fine.Would it be OK to look at the room ?
neutral,How much do you charge ?
neutral,"35.00 dollars a week , but I don ’ t allow smoking ."
neutral,"I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour ."
neutral,I don't know .
neutral,"Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days ."
neutral,Do you take in students ?
neutral,Please follow my instructions . Use a wet towel to cover your mouth and nose . Walk quietly to th nearest emergency exit . Now go get the wet towel .
neutral,"Sir , I need to go back to get my jewelry box ."
neutral,Don't take your personal belongings . We need to get out of the building now !
neutral,What ? What did you buy ?
neutral,What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
neutral,"There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick ."
neutral,I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?
neutral,He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .
neutral,That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .
neutral,"You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?"
neutral,But I am still worry about them . I ’ m afraid ...
neutral,I know . But at that time your blame is rubbing salt into his wounds .
neutral,"I ’ m playing with my toys , Dad ."
neutral,"You ’ d better tidy up the room now , or you ’ ll get your mum ’ s back up ."
neutral,How are you getting along with your studies ?
neutral,"Where is our son , dear ?"
neutral,I don ’ t know what activity my son should take part in ?
neutral,But we need the exact time . What time ?
neutral,I hope so .
neutral,Let's look at our menus .
neutral,I didn ’ t have any change .
neutral,Tell me why you didn ’ t come to see me tonight then .
neutral,"I want to make an omelet , so actually this is really silly , I've never made one before . How do you make an omelet ?"
neutral,"Well , I can teach you how I make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special ."
neutral,What're you doing now ?
neutral,"No , you needn't do that . You'd better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes ."
neutral,Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it .
neutral,What part hurts ?
neutral,"We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ?"
neutral,"Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound ."
neutral,We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike .
neutral,Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .
neutral,Guess where we ended up .
neutral,What ?
neutral,How ?
neutral,And what is the problem ?
neutral,"What's the matter , Paul ?"
neutral,Yes . The police have come .
neutral,Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time .
neutral,Could you help me with these books ?
neutral,"Please , George ."
neutral,"Tell me what ’ s the matter with you , Bill ."
neutral,What words ? Can you tell me ?
neutral,"Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable ."
neutral,"I suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . If he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness ."
neutral,"I do it , too . You know , sometimes when we eat , my child would pull a dish towards him and grab it with his hands and eat . And if it were something he doesn ’ t like , he would spit it out and throw it into other dishes . He does it very often . I really get mad . I can ’ t help spank him sometimes ."
neutral,Yeah . Complete with nice of you .
neutral,"Mm , let me see . I think there are 2 in the bedroom , and 1 each in the living room and kitchen ."
neutral,I call the landlord right now .
neutral,"Before you send the lease , do you have any questions ?"
neutral,How much is the cable ?
neutral,"It's not your birthday , also not mine . Hey , come on . Just tell me ."
neutral,I'm OK .
neutral,"OK . I want to make an omelet , so actually this is really silly , I've never made one before . How do you make an omelet ?"
neutral,"Great . But no talking , now . Don't forget that you are on a ladder . Take care !"
neutral,"But you are holding it for me . Nothing to worry about . I trust you . Oops , what's that ?"
neutral,What would happen if they started attacking you ?
neutral,I see . Why do people come all the way here to pick apples by themselves and take them home ? Isn't it easier for them to buy the apples in the supermarket ?
neutral,Is that true ?
neutral,"Well , with the ticket , you can get a free drink . What would you like ? Orange juice ?"
neutral,"Yes , orange juice will be fine for me . But how can you get the drink ? It's so crowded there around the counter . You can barely move ."
neutral,"Daddy , what's next ? What else do we do now ?"
neutral,I want to have a look at the microwave ovens .
neutral,Good morning . I need a new identification card .
neutral,I've brought with me some of old ones .
neutral,"yes , we can look at the computer and computer menu at the same time . And this will help us understand both better ."
neutral,What are you doing to your house ?
neutral,We're redecorating our living room .
neutral,"Er , I am gonna go with salt and sauce !"
neutral,I remember Mom going with a lot of pepper for the meat .
neutral,What is your father doing now ?
neutral,I will .
neutral,How far do we have to go ?
neutral,"But it ’ s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend , isn ’ t it ?"
neutral,Right .
neutral,My watch says ten past .
neutral,Are you sure half past seven ?
neutral,Positive . I ’ ll put the radio on .
neutral,"Yes , on Monday ."
neutral,"Oh , I don't know . Of course , gasoline costs a lot these days ."
neutral,"But what about parking ? You can't park on the street , can you ?"
neutral,how about rock and roll 。
neutral,"oh , it's really beautiful . but i just can't dance it well ."
neutral,ok .
neutral,Can I help you ?
neutral,Aren't there any trains before 10 thirty ?
neutral,Then one to New York at 10 thirty .
neutral,10 fifteen a . m .
neutral,"If you get on before 4 p . m . or after 6 p . m . there is saver return which is $ 9.45 , an ordinary return is $ 16.45 ."
neutral,Laura told me today that she has a friend with a car for sale .
neutral,"Yes , it's used , but she said it was in very good shape . It's a small foreign car ."
neutral,"Hi , Nancy . How are you doing ?"
neutral,"Hi , Tom . Want a cup of coffee ?"
neutral,Uh huh . How about a used car ? They've got good ones now .
neutral,"It's the same kind of deal though , you know , you never know what you're going to get ."
neutral,may i ask you for a dance .
neutral,would you like to learn to tango Donar ?
neutral,i am offering you my services . for your church . what do you say ?
neutral,"Wow , that's something new . Let's go ! What's this , honey ?"
neutral,There we go .
neutral,"Bingo ! It's dark outside , Let's hurry up ."
neutral,Several minutes .
neutral,Maybe .
neutral,"It smells sweet . Mom and May are gonna love it . Get them for dinner , Daniel !"
neutral,"Mommy , dinner , please !"
neutral,"What's up , Bro ? What's in the bulletin ?"
neutral,It says that there will be a blackout from 5 p . m . to 7 p . m . in our neighborhood today .
neutral,What makes you think that ?
neutral,About 6 .
neutral,Yes . I am in a hurry . Please take a shortcut .
neutral,"Oh , my poor Danny , sure , you are a man . But you know , running like this in street is very dangerous ."
neutral,"Ever since I saw computer can do your project , I wanted to have a computer ."
neutral,Your sister is in high school now ; no one plays the piano at home .
neutral,"Anyway , I will have a look at the piano class after work by myself ."
neutral,"Oh yeah and decorating the house too was colored paper and pictures . they will put a Christmas tree just inside the front door , pained toys and colored electric lights along the branches and plays all the gift packages under it"
neutral,"Yes , I don't know why it doesn't work this time ."
neutral,Don't worry . Have you got receipt with you ?
neutral,It looks like the hairstyle of Kahn who stands beside him in the picture .
neutral,"Do it , please ."
neutral,"I'm sick of it , too ."
neutral,"It shouldn't be long . Thirty minutes , tops . Are you in a hurry ?"
neutral,"Yes , I'm looking for a house ."
neutral,About 300 a month .
neutral,"Yes , I think so . There is also an interesting one . It's opposite the park ."
neutral,Okay then . And I also want to have my hair colored .
neutral,When do you want to move in ?
neutral,See you tomorrow .
neutral,Where do you need it to be delivered to ?
neutral,I want to post it to Shanghai .
neutral,"Hello , I'd like to subscribe to a magazine ."
neutral,Fitness Consultant .
neutral,"What can I do for you , Ma'am ?"
neutral,"Can I have my check , please ."
neutral,You mean I should make an appointment ahead of time ?
neutral,"Here is your change and your receipt.Do you have goods unpaid on you , sir"
neutral,That's all right .
neutral,Probably . People's consumptive habit is changing rapidly because of the internet .
neutral,Stuff like that but I think the lion dance is a bit too difficult and dangerous .
neutral,We got a problem . The deposit boxes are all full . We should have come earlier .
neutral,I surely did ! Ask the customer service counter if we can deposit our stuff there .
neutral,Good morning . There is no reason to miss so beautiful a morning . Is that a new bird ?
neutral,Maybe you can teach Lulu some English words .
neutral,Don't be a smarty-pants . It's for Grandma Wang .
neutral,Bad timing . I want to see them so much . How are they ?
neutral,"Not bad . I heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ?"
neutral,Did you go to a real estate agent ?
neutral,Probably on the of the cabinet . I'll go and get it .
neutral,"Daddy , look ahead in the distance , the mountains there . They roll all the way up to the sky ."
neutral,"Got it , Mom ."
neutral,Just kids like that .
neutral,It is called Energy Collector .
neutral,I want to have a try later .
neutral,The fried shrimp is crunchy ! But my mom will never cook shrimp this way . She always says that fried food is not healthy .
neutral,"Oh , it's rice rolls with fried shrimp inside ."
neutral,Why not ? It's my parking space .
neutral,But I saw a red car always parking here before .
neutral,That's all right . It's not your fault .
neutral,I bet it is always full of cars .
neutral,How mush would it cost if someone parks here for one hour and ten minutes ?
neutral,I've just had it repainted .
neutral,That's my wife !
neutral,Is this your first time here ? Where are you going ?
neutral,"Oh , there are many Chinese antique stores . They get paintings , too . Do you get interested in them ?"
neutral,"May I help you , sir ?"
neutral,"No , thanks . I'm in a hurry ."
neutral,No .
neutral,What park do you want to go to ?
neutral,"Right , ah . It is so close to our home . How come we've never thought of that ?"
neutral,The Olympic Park has a small forest . It is fit for picnic .
neutral,"May , do you mind helping me prepare for the picnic ?"
neutral,Yes . It says it will be sunny all day . No sign of rain at all.This is your father's favorite sausage . Sandwiches for you and Daniel .
neutral,"Daddy , we can't have a photo of the whole family . We can take one here ."
neutral,"Excuse me , sir . Could you take a photo for us ? Just press this button ."
neutral,"That's OK , Ben , just let it go . I thought you were just a little too much into it ."
neutral,"Seriously , if we will adopt any animals , we'd gotta to talk to Daniel ."
neutral,"OK . Let ’ s go over there . For the Lantern Festival , you should never omit the Yuanxiao ."
neutral,"Actually , they are small dumpling balls made of glutinous rice flour . They are like Tangun ."
neutral,"Honey , I am sorry that I am too busy most of the time ."
neutral,What did you do last weekend ?
neutral,"After that , we will have a picnic ."
neutral,"Then , do you have “ tea time ” every day ? I mean , do you drink tea at a settled time ?"
neutral,You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale .
neutral,"As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country ."
neutral,"Honey , which hand should I use to hold the fork ?"
neutral,"Sure . Rather than eating , having western food is more about western culture ."
neutral,There is no need to do that . I think the restaurant accepts credit cards . But it's necessary to make a budget .
neutral,It seems that it's all about me . Then what do you do ?
neutral,Don't forget about the dessert .
neutral,"Not really , especially at the beginning , if you wear high heels all day long , your feet would hurt . But , no big deal . Women can always get used to that ."
neutral,"That's true . Well , it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . So , do you spend all your money on it ?"
neutral,How is it that you are my mom's sis ? You two are so different . She always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns . You do so much better than her .
neutral,All right . What kind of red wine do you serve ?
neutral,The dry red wine looks quite good . I'd like to try this one .
neutral,Then do you like any cheese to go with it ?
neutral,"Oh , no . But cheese is the best thing to go with red wine . And we have really fresh cheese which will be free if you order red wine . Here are the pictures . Pick out something you like ."
neutral,"Yes , the cost for dry-cleaning is three times of that for ordinary laundering . But for suits and sweaters , you can only take them to the dry cleaners ' ."
neutral,That will be 80 Yuan altogether . Here is your invoice .
neutral,"Yes , the sugar was burnt during the dry-cleaning process . And there you go ."
neutral,This is a membership card . You can get a 20 percent discount next time .
neutral,We came too early . There're still three hours before the performance starts .
neutral,Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ?
neutral,Hello . I'm thinking about watching a Chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl . What's on this weekend ?
neutral,"Well , there will be charity performance on Saturday night . And also , there will be a solo concert by an opera star on Sunday night ."
neutral,Sure . It's to raise money for the homeless .
neutral,It surely is . And the cast is really the best .
neutral,"Sorry . Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine ."
neutral,Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
neutral,It's possible . But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
neutral,"Actually , I don't know exactly . Do you have anything recommended ?"
neutral,"Because in this duty-free shop , your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife ."
neutral,"Oh , my God . I've totally forgotten about that . Anyway , I think she would like a bottle of perfume ."
neutral,It's $ 60 here .
neutral,I can't agree on that . Just cut it out . Give him a break and don't spoil the day .
neutral,"Well , OK . you are always right ."
neutral,"Well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . First , make sure they don't go far from the railings ."
neutral,"That's a good idea . And remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings ."
neutral,OK . Anything else ?
neutral,"Because he takes after you , he's got into trouble again ."
neutral,"That ’ s okay . I ’ m sorry , too . It ’ s a good idea to prepare for the future possibilities ."
neutral,"I've got all the presents I need , and my family is working together to get all the food ready . That's easy , but I have another problem to deal with ."
neutral,"No , I did that a long time ago . It's about telling my son the truth about Santa Claus ."
neutral,You think it's better that he should be told ?
neutral,Want to send out for some Chinese ?
neutral,Some what ?
neutral,"Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered ."
neutral,Sure . Is it sweet ?
neutral,"Oh , come on . I will be back as early as possible ."
neutral,"Bargaining is a game , or even a battle . You feel like a winner when you get a good price ."
neutral,That's true . But I just love it . Come here !
neutral,What about this picture ? I think Benjamin would like it .
neutral,"Hey , Terry , have all the players got here ?"
neutral,"Yeah , most of them have arrived . Don't worry . There are still 20 minutes left before the match ."
neutral,Look out . Catch the ball . You should dunk besides the three-point line .
neutral,"No problem , I once played a 2 - meter-high player successfully ."
neutral,There're a lot of chuckholes on this old highway . Driving on it is experience-demanding .
neutral,Ok . You drive and do be careful .
neutral,Is anti-virus software necessary for a PC ?
neutral,Of course . You'd better learn something about it .
neutral,I'll say yes . Wait a minute . I need an IC card .
neutral,"Oh , we should . There are so many people . What if the train got full before we could get in ?"
neutral,Because I need to use the restroom . Is there a restroom on the train ?
neutral,Why not ? You told me that subway is a kind of train . If it had no restroom . what kind of train would that be ?
neutral,I'm from England and I'm trying to make a travel plan for today .
neutral,What brings you here ?
neutral,"Oh , it's not very far . And as far as I know it is a fancy place ."
neutral,"Dad , it makes no sense ."
neutral,"Oh , you see , we are on the 8th floor , and moving into the 6th floor in another building . It is about 15 kilometers to get there ."
neutral,That was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . I think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on .
neutral,"Hi , my name is Ted , what's yours ?"
neutral,"Do you come here often , Laura ?"
neutral,"No , this is my first time here ."
neutral,"No , it's easy . We'll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip . They'll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund ."
neutral,"What do you do there ... hang around , like the kids ?"
neutral,"Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will ."
neutral,"Well , I guess I just wasn't paying attention to the speedometer ."
neutral,A house would be great . I could plant a garden . And you could use the garage for a workshop .
neutral,When is the place available ?
neutral,I don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in New York .
neutral,I have an AIR pass card and I want to withdraw money from the bank .
neutral,"Hey there Chris , what are you up to ?"
neutral,I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models .
neutral,"Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ?"
neutral,I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice .
neutral,That is what I am looking for . Could I go to see the house tomorrow afternoon ?
neutral,Certainly ! But I have to contact my friend first .
neutral,So is there a refrigerator ?
neutral,It ’ s $ 8.50 a month .
neutral,"Wow , like how do they train the dogs ?"
neutral,"Sometimes we'll see them , they'll have like sort of conventions of reunions of the pets so , yeah , you get to see them once in awhile ."
neutral,Is there anything wrong ?
neutral,Someone robbed my apartment last week . The robber took $ 550 .
neutral,Why not ?
neutral,"You ’ re home late today , David . How was school ?"
neutral,Excuse me .
neutral,"Um , this steak , I asked for to be medium rare ."
neutral,Would you like to see our new shirts ?
neutral,"Sorry , but I ’ m not really interested in those things ."
neutral,I ’ m afraid I ’ m not interested in fashion .
neutral,"You've got it , sir ."
neutral,Yes . Should I take off my coat ?
neutral,"Let me see , with padding and lining cloth , it comes to 357 dollars altogether ."
neutral,All right . When can I get it ?
neutral,In two weeks .
neutral,Three days later .
neutral,Are you going home now ?
neutral,I'm going to try to find a place near the office .
neutral,Where are you living now ?
neutral,"Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it ."
neutral,"Well , only you liked it really , darling ."
neutral,Ok .
neutral,Do you promise ?
neutral,"Tom , darling . You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? Please !"
neutral,"After you ’ Ve chopped the vegetables , could you fry the meat in a little oil ? Just use a very small amount of oil . Fry the meat until it is cooked , then we ’ ll add some spices to flavor it ."
neutral,Promise you are not going to be angry ?
neutral,"Ah , ah , you promised , and remember ?"
neutral,Just a minute . I need to make a list of thinks that we need .
neutral,"Good idea . Have you written down potatoes , carrots , and onions ?"
neutral,"We don ’ t have enough cash , so I ’ ll take my credit card and we can pay with that . Where are the car keys ?"
neutral,What would you let me do now ?
neutral,I'll do with the cake .
neutral,"Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing ."
neutral,It ’ s just the right size-a perfect fit ! Have you seen anything you like ?
neutral,When did it first break down ?
neutral,"Ok . I ’ ll start by looking at the motor . I ’ ll just unplug it and take a look inside the machine ... oh , yes . There ’ s the problem . It ’ s quite simple . I ’ ll sort it out in a few minutes ."
neutral,"Hey there , you look a little lost . Are you new here ?"
neutral,It ’ s not that much . Just watch ... I ’ m ok ...
neutral,Excuse me . Do you know where I can find the nearest ICCC ?
neutral,Do I need to take a bus ?
neutral,This bus doesn't take you directly there . You'd have to change buses twice . I suggest you walk . It'll take you less than 20 minutes .
neutral,Keep walking and look for a tall building .
neutral,"Just a few Christmas gifts , to this season , after all !"
neutral,"Alright , alright . I ’ m coming ."
neutral,"Hurry up , get in ."
neutral,Geez ! What ’ s the rush ?
neutral,"Don ’ t worry about it , just drive . Oh , no , the light is about to change . . . step on it !"
neutral,"You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . You have the right to have an attorney present during questioning . If you cannot afford an attorney , one will be appointed for you . Do you understand ?"
neutral,Yes .
neutral,I don't know him .
neutral,How many times did you stab the victim ?
neutral,Did you know hat your actions might cause serous injuries or death ?
neutral,What did I do ? I haven't done anything .
neutral,Howdy ! Nice car ! What seems to be the problem ?
neutral,OK . What do you want to know ?
neutral,Please show me your passport and Residence Permit .
neutral,I'm a professor at a university .
neutral,"That ’ s it , my lease is up . I have to move ."
neutral,Plastic . I also have a couple of coupons .
neutral,Will this be debit or credit ?
neutral,Okay . Um ... can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .
neutral,"Um , I ’ m just having a look around . It ’ s my girlfriend ’ s birthday tomorrow . I'm trying to find her something ."
neutral,"Well , do you want a thong , some bikini briefs , maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts ?"
neutral,"Um yes , I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni , olives , and extra cheese ."
neutral,We have a two-for-one special on large pizzas.Would you like a large pizza instead ?
neutral,"Okay , okay , what do you want ?"
neutral,"We need lots of things . I ’ ll make a list . We need a bag of sugar , a loaf of bread and a crate of beer ."
neutral,We should also get a tube of toothpaste and a bar of soap . Let ’ s get a tub of ice cream too . We can treat ourselves .
neutral,I ’ d like a few cans of coke . We also need a dozen eggs and half a dozen sausages .
neutral,There ’ s an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs . We have a subsidiary company located there .
neutral,Are the reports favorable ?
neutral,What ’ s in that section ?
neutral,Please pull your vehicle over to the side of the road . Please roll down your window .
neutral,"But , sir , I didn't drink at all ."
neutral,"Yes , I do . The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month . Do you every buy magazines ?"
neutral,I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine .
neutral,I ’ m sure he would . We usually have to drag him home .
neutral,"She spends less time outdoors and she used to . we have no idea where she goes . She ’ s very secretive . Occasionally , she brings back a dead mouse ."
neutral,Have you ever thought about having another pet ?
neutral,What are you reading ?
neutral,"Oh , it ’ s the latest novel by Ray Blue . It ’ s a sic-fi thriller ."
neutral,We ’ re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ?
neutral,This is sure to be a worthwhile read .
neutral,"I have apple pie , ice cream , chocolate cake and fruit cocktail ."
neutral,"I ’ m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling , like poker . If I did , I ’ d lose all my money ."
neutral,"I can play quite well . I have a friend who likes playing , but she ’ s not very good at it . Shall I invite her to play ?"
neutral,"I ’ m fairly busy , so I really need an animal that I don ’ t need to care of very much . Actually , I ’ d like a pet that ’ s a little unusual . I don't ’ really want a typical pet , like a cat , dog , or hamster . Do you have any suggestions ?"
neutral,"Not really . By the way , I don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake ."
neutral,"We have those , but I only sell them to people I know well , for obvious reasons . How about a lizard ? I have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after ."
neutral,I think I should join a fitness centre . I am getting a little fat and I'm totally out of shape . Even a quick walk of a few hundred metres leaves me out of breath .
neutral,Why don't you try smoking one cigarette less each day ? How many do you smoke each day now ?
neutral,Sure . Is today only you second visit ?
neutral,They sell them at the shop around the corner . We can go and get some in a few minutes .
neutral,It only takes a few minutes . Some people like their meat well done . Others like it rare . The great thing about a barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked .
neutral,"Obviously , it depends on what I'm cooking , but I'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours ."
neutral,Which kinds of meat are most popular in your country ?
neutral,"Yes , I have . I tried them when I visited your country last year . I thought they were very tasty . Can you cook them ?"
neutral,No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables .
neutral,"You can have some fruit for dessert . If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake ."
neutral,"So , how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet ."
neutral,I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself .
neutral,Those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you ’ re reading or watching tv . How big is your living room ?
neutral,I ’ d suggest you buy two . That allows you to change the brightness of the room better .
neutral,I have redecorated my bedroom . I decide to repaint the walls and change the pictures . I also bought a new pair of curtains . What do you think of it ?
neutral,You can get cheap carpets easily . Another idea is to buy a rug . That would cover a lot of the carpet and you wouldn ’ t have to replace the carpet . It would save you a lot of work .
neutral,"We eat a lot of sweet corn , broccoli and eggplant ."
neutral,Because we don ’ t grow it much in my country . We import a lot from other countries .
neutral,"I see . We grow a lot of fruit and vegetables in my country . We export a lot of melons , grapes , oranges and lemons . In your country , do you eat corn on the cob ? It's very popular in my country ."
neutral,"While you ’ re cleaning the cooker , I ’ ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meal , by the way ."
neutral,Keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it .
neutral,Have you seen Bill recently ?
neutral,"You have to be very careful with seafood . It tastes lovely , but it often causes upset stomachs . Have you heard anything from Tom ?"
neutral,"I see . My niece just flew back from Australia to visit . She ’ s got jetlag now . she ’ s just resting today , but we ’ ll probably go out somewhere tomorrow ."
neutral,It ’ s easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers .
neutral,Oh yes . I ’ Ve got it written down here . Just a minute .
neutral,You really shouldn ’ t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like .
neutral,"I can just enter the amount using the key , right ?"
neutral,"Certainly . Could you put it on the scales , so I can check the weight ?"
neutral,Airmail should take four or five days and surface mail should take about two weeks .
neutral,How can I help you ?
neutral,I seem to have lost my train ticket .
neutral,I ’ m supposed to be going to shanghai .
neutral,Z3264356 .
neutral,Perhaps it ’ s in your other pocket .
neutral,Yes . I ’ d like to book a table for Friday evening please .
neutral,"No , we turn right . Remember that we are coming from this direction ."
neutral,We can only go fast on the motor ways if there isn ’ t much traffic . I think we should allow ourselves plenty of time to get there . Being early is much better than being late .
neutral,"No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday ."
neutral,"Yes , that's possible ."
neutral,You see . I told you you'd hit him if you weren't careful .
neutral,Why don't we get ourselves a new car ? The old one's falling apart .
neutral,What kind shall we get ?
neutral,Where shall we go ?
neutral,"Fine , We'll do that ."
neutral,"No , it ’ s 3725019281 ."
neutral,They must have got in through the kitchen window .
neutral,We haven't . Hurry up !
neutral,Come on ! It's time to go !
neutral,We hope so .
neutral,"Oh , don't you ? God save me !"
neutral,That's right . Then you will follow the signs to Gate 85 .
neutral,Be careful !
neutral,Sure . Can I get to the central department stall this way ?
neutral,It ’ s about fifteen minutes ’ walk . That ’ s all .
neutral,Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager .
neutral,You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision .
neutral,"Oh , she can make her own decisions ."
neutral,"You ’ re home late today , David . How was school ?"
neutral,"Oh , what ’ s she like ?"
neutral,Is she strict ?
neutral,"Betty , something is burning . Can you smell it ?"
neutral,Look ! The iron is still on .
neutral,"Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ?"
neutral,You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study .
neutral,What else I ’ Ve got to do ? Join the army ?
neutral,Who knows ! That might come to later .
neutral,I am so busy today .
neutral,"Dreadful . There , the door is open now ."
neutral,"OK . Come back into the classroom , class ."
neutral,"Mam , another minute , could I ?"
neutral,"Right . ( five minutes later ) Now , what are you having ?"
neutral,Mike ! Look at the floor !
neutral,What's wrong with it ?
neutral,Oh ...
neutral,What are you looking for now ?
neutral,"Well , they ' re not here . They are in the dustbin ."
neutral,"Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies ."
neutral,Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ?
neutral,"Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff ."
neutral,What's wrong with it ?
neutral,"So , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ?"
neutral,I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils .
neutral,"Yes , I have . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over ."
neutral,"Both kinds of food are becoming popular . Nowadays , it ’ s very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket ."
neutral,"Loretta ? No , she can't come , she's busy ."
neutral,We'd like to rent a flat near the university .
neutral,"Yes , we are . Obviously , we'd like something as cheap as possible . We've heard that there are places for 80 to 100 pounds a month ."
neutral,"Yes , ma'ma . There'll be no problem with the quality ."
neutral,"I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home ."
neutral,I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
neutral,I like this apartment . Do you think we can afford the mortgage ?
neutral,"So , tell me about you new house . How is it different to your old one ?"
neutral,"So , it ’ s a three-bedrooms detached house ?"
neutral,"Yes , they are . That ’ s very important to us . We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . Each room has large windows ."
neutral,Do you have a balcony ?
neutral,You should get plenty of sleep .
neutral,Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ?
neutral,One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet !
neutral,What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ?
neutral,That ’ s out of the question .
neutral,Please .
neutral,Not even for an hour ?
neutral,Perhaps you left that at school .
neutral,Does he have a moustache or a beard ?
neutral,"Sounds like Mike , is it ?"
neutral,"Yes , it is . You describe someone we both know ."
neutral,"I like slim girls , so I doubt I would find a plump girl attractive . You ’ ll have to give me some more information ."
neutral,"She ’ s got tiny feet and wears really unfashionable shoes . In fact , she wears unfashionable clothes too ."
neutral,This doesn ’ t sound like anyone I know . I give up . Teel me who she is .
neutral,Shall we have some white wine then ?
neutral,What would you like for dessert ?
neutral,"I just want to have a coffee , I think ."
neutral,"Medium rare , that ’ s right , sir . I remember your order ."
neutral,"If it is not to your satisfaction , I ’ ll certainly bring you another . But I ’ m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes ."
neutral,Cow while Boots .
neutral,All right . That Nealy done a little .
neutral,That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .
neutral,"No , early saturday morning ."
neutral,"No , I like the fish ."
neutral,What ever you say ?
neutral,Yes ?
neutral,Why not ?
neutral,Where it is ?
neutral,"No , not all summer . Just for six weeks ."
neutral,"Take care , Peter . Don't run so fast . Are you tired ?"
neutral,"Oh , yes . May I sit on the grass ?"
neutral,"Yes , I can see it . But what's on it ?"
neutral,Why not ?
neutral,Can't you see the notes there ? It says ' No smoking here ' .
neutral,"This seems a pretty nice room , I should say ."
neutral,How about your sideburns ?
neutral,I made an appointment for a perm at 3 o'clock .
neutral,Would you like a shampoo first ?
neutral,"I'd like a permanent wave . By the way , do you have any picture of the latest hairstyle ? I ' Ve been in this style for so long that I want a change this time ."
neutral,"Come here , please . We'd like to wash your hair first . That way it will be easier to cut and style . I think you'll like this style . It's very fashionable ."
neutral,"Good morning , sir ."
neutral,Do you have a particular style in mind ?
neutral,"The kind that never goes out of fashion , I guess ."
neutral,I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes .
neutral,I'm sure you're right . I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year .
neutral,I would like to have a new suit made . something in a dark blue wool .
neutral,"Miss , where do you want to go ?"
neutral,Do I need to pay any extra change for my suitcases ?
neutral,Yes . Do you know where it is ?
neutral,I'll do my best .
neutral,Shall we share a taxi ?
neutral,That's the one .
neutral,"Can I help you , sir ?"
neutral,"Yes , I'm looking for a cap . Size 16 ."
neutral,All right . How about this one ?
neutral,"Of course , madam ."
neutral,"Can I help you , madam ?"
neutral,"Yes , madam , I agree . What size are you ?"
neutral,"Oh , spinach , I think ."
neutral,Come this way . Here's the dressing room .
neutral,The Cathedral ?
neutral,May I help you ?
neutral,I'm looking for a pair of shoes .
neutral,What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale .
neutral,They are $ 168 .
neutral,Good coming .
neutral,It doesn't take much time . I ' m used to tidying up my room myself .
neutral,On Memorial Avenue ?
neutral,"Well , do you know where the post office is ?"
neutral,"By the way , do you know the price of the gas now ?"
neutral,I'm afraid I don't . But I do know the price has gone up .
neutral,Can I help you ?
neutral,I need some stamps for this letter .
neutral,I want it registered . How much is it then ?
neutral,"Well , the letter is going to a friend of mine in America and it's quite urgent . It really needs to be posted today , so here you are ."
neutral,Here you are .
neutral,Is there a way that I can be sure that the people in South america receive my package ?
neutral,Let me give you a hand . The author is ...
neutral,Margaret Mitchell .
neutral,How about the price of the hardcover ?
neutral,About five weeks .
neutral,Just a moment . I'll weigh it .
neutral,"Well , it has a cassette record ... a cassette tape ."
neutral,3 dollars .
neutral,"Then , what's special tonight ?"
neutral,"I think so . Could I have you name , telephone number ? If we get one , I will call you ."
neutral,The next bus will be here in four minutes .
neutral,"No , it won't ."
neutral,"Excuse me , do the buses stop here ?"
neutral,I want to go to Broadway and 82nd Street . Can I take any bus that comes along ?
neutral,"You'll soon get accustomed to it . It's not difficult . Well , here's the bus . Fortunately , it's not full ."
neutral,Excuse me . Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo ?
neutral,I'm going to the hospital to see Susan .
neutral,The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street .
neutral,Does this one look big enough ?
neutral,"Well , what do you think of the aluminum pan ?"
neutral,I need to save the rest .
neutral,"Hi , did you call for an exterminator ?"
neutral,umm ... yeah ! I ’ m looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend . Our fifth anniversary ’ s next Friday .
neutral,"Mom , I'm ready for school ."
neutral,I am returning something that I bought yesterday .
neutral,It keeps turning off on it's own .
neutral,Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you ?
neutral,It's worth a shot .
neutral,How is the condition ? How old is it ?
neutral,What are you doing ?
neutral,OK . I get it . I'm getting back into bed ...
neutral,I should get the items within a week . But in the meantime I'm bidding on a digital video camera .
neutral,"No , it doesn't . And there's a maintenance fee for each month . It's forty NT per ping ."
neutral,So how long do you plan to live here ?
neutral,Yes . We've signed them before . We even brought our chops .
neutral,"We'll sign our signatures , too . And give you our passport numbers along with our ARC numbers ."
neutral,"Sure , why not ? I think I want a chocolate chip cookie , too ."
neutral,This building is only four years old . It was built with central air .
neutral,"Well , it's forty pings including the balcony . See . It's huge ."
neutral,"I'm sorry . No pets are allowed in this apartment building , except fish ."
neutral,"Well , fish it will be then ."
neutral,"No , please , Mom ! Don't make me gargle with saltwater !"
neutral,See ? That wasn't so bad .
neutral,"Morning , Mom ."
neutral,"No , I'm fine . I don't need to see a doctor ."
neutral,OK . I'll go see the doctor .
neutral,"Come to think of it , you should get out your English books and catch up on your reading assignments ."
neutral,"You say that now , Lily , but you'll thank me later . I'm your mom , and mother knows best ."
neutral,Maybe I'll run away first .
neutral,"Johnny , are you just sitting around again ?"
neutral,Yes'm .
neutral,You mean Johnny threw out all the dinnerware ?
neutral,Well ... uh ... how about a glass of juice instead ?
neutral,No . I'd like tea . Can you put it in my favorite cup ? You probably washed it ...
neutral,"Oh , yeah . Well , uh , about your mug ..."
neutral,No time . That's their headlights in the window !
neutral,"Little dude , your life is over !"
neutral,No time to worry . We have to dispose of this evidence .
neutral,"Yes , I hear about it every time she comes here ."
neutral,So can we play PlayStation later ?
neutral,Sure I ' ll have the burrito . Do you have nachos ?
neutral,Would you like anything to drink ?
neutral,"Sure , I ' ll have a Corona ."
neutral,Yeah here you go . Actually I also want to return this keyboard .
neutral,Aren't you lucky . The vintage-clock guy is driving a hard bargain . So I have nothing .
neutral,"Johnny , have you tidied up your room yet ?"
neutral,Thirty bucks a record . Or five for one hundred and twenty bucks .
neutral,OK . Five for eighty-five bucks . That's my final offer .
neutral,"Oh , why not ? I'll take ' em ."
neutral,No wonder you didn't get my texts !
neutral,"In that case , eight o'clock is fine ."
neutral,You eat too much junk food . That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol .
neutral,"OK , so now we need a baking pan right ?"
neutral,"Yeah , but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes ."
neutral,Hey honey ! Where were you ?
neutral,"Oh yes , I ..."
neutral,Will that be all ?
neutral,"Ok , so can I say , "" This is Abby's voicemail . I will call you later , so leave me your name and number "" ."
neutral,He got a three here which means it's unsatisfactory . We should work on that with him .
neutral,"A bit of both . Some cousins , aunts and uncles will be there , but also some friends from the neighborhood ."

neutral,Like what ? I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction .
neutral,Here you go .
neutral,What's my other option ?
neutral,"The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options ."
neutral,"I see . So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay ? That's a white wine , right ?"
neutral,"Yes , this is one of our best-sellers . It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier , which means it's more approachable . It's light and crisp , with a bit of a vanilla aroma ."
neutral,"Well , first they exfoliate my face , getting rid of all the dead skin . Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young . Afterwards , they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks ."
neutral,"That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in . In any case , I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day ."

neutral,She doesn't mind if you don't mind getting your feet stepped on .
neutral,"I don ’ t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly . I don ’ t want bows . I find slingbacks very uncomfortable . Those might as well be stilettos . Too modern . Ah , finally , this is what I ’ m looking for ."
neutral,Seven-and-a-half .
neutral,"Hmmm.Not good . They ’ re too tight.The length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes . And there ’ d be no room for my insoles . You know what ?

neutral,We can do that . It'll just cost you extra .
neutral,"It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine ."

neutral,Welcome to Al ’ s Garage . What seems to be the problem ?
neutral,"Not that long ago , I think it was four months ago ."
neutral,The mangoes are on sale today .
neutral,"It's hard to describe . They're sweet , but also sort of acidity ."

neutral,"I'm sorry , but can you give me a three-day turnaround ?"
neutral,"Good morning , Angela , how have you been lately ?"

neutral,Have you treated any real emergencies ?
neutral,Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency .

neutral,"Well , you should have kept an eye on it ."
neutral,"Yes , I wanna buy a skirt ."

neutral,I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .
neutral,"Well , do you want a thong , some bikini briefs , maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts ?"

neutral,a crate of beer ? Why do we need that ?
neutral,just joking . I would like to get a few bottles of beer though . We also need a liter of cooking oil .

neutral,"no , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't ."
neutral,"alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill ."
neutral,"Hey , Robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . Where did you get it ?"
neutral,"yeah , I know that . But at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off ."
neutral,"true , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time ."
neutral,that's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to .
neutral,"oh , Sam ! Is this your dog ?"
neutral,"cool down , Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ?"
neutral,can I get you something to drink ?

neutral,"Where did you empty the basket , Bill ?"
neutral,"No , he cleaned it last time . It's your turn ."
neutral,"They were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health . And yes , John , we need organic carrots ..."
neutral,"Hello , could I speak to Allison , please ?"
neutral,"Not at all . No hidden fees or surcharges , it is a flat monthly rate ."
neutral,"Ok , sir , it sounds like you might have a virus ."
neutral,Yeah I know . I also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one . I am also getting a rice cooker and steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies .
neutral,"Hi , good morning , Miss ? what can I help you with ?"
neutral,Good morning I'd like to mail this box of books to Taiwan .
neutral,Usually about two month .

neutral,I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time .
neutral,Have you tried this one ? It ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free .
neutral,There ’ s so much I want to do . I ’ Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download .
neutral,How do I do that ?
neutral,"I know you are keen on photography . It ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at a"
neutral,"Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides ."
neutral,"So , are you going to quit driving to work then ?"
neutral,No ! Five minutes I promise !
neutral,"Oh , you like the rolling machine ."
neutral,"Oh , good , do you have a discount for two ?"
neutral,"That is great , i will take this two , how much is that ?"
neutral,"Yes , we do , debit or credit ?"
neutral,Debit card .
neutral,It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway .

neutral,"Why ? If I eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ?"
neutral,Don ’ t count on it .
neutral,"When I was your age , my parents didn ’ t have central heating like you do ! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . We used it to cook , heat the house and even dry our clothes ! We never caught a cold . You should be grateful !"
neutral,I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP !
neutral,"Well , I ’ m looking to get a custom-made suit ."
neutral,"Ah , well then I ’ d recommend a nice entry-level digital SLR ."
neutral,Yeah ? Can I take a look at the Sirs you carry ?
neutral,Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ?
neutral,"No , no no no chicken breasts at the moment , but we have some nice chicken thighs ."
neutral,"No , that won ’ t do . I ’ ll take this smoked ham you have here ."
neutral,"Mmm ... No that ’ s okay , really . I think that ’ s all for today ."
neutral,Very well.This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
neutral,"Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier ."
neutral,"Yes , but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !"
neutral,"OK , I know where this is going . How much will it cost me to get a new computer ?"
neutral,"Well , this desktop over here is our latest model . It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte . Of course , it includes a mouse , keyboard and desk speakers ."
neutral,It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld .
neutral,"No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too ."
neutral,I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth .
neutral,I don't know . I feel like going out .
neutral,It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer .
neutral,"No , it just won't work.If I read for your exam , you won't know the answers tomorrow . I will ."
neutral,About fourteen .
neutral,"I see . Let me have a look . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ’ s why it won ’ t flush . Let me just get my plunger . No , that ’ s not working either . I suspect that there ’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage . That ’ s what ’ s making your toilet overflow ."
neutral,"Well , you get nine hundred anytime minutes , and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other Tel-Mobile clients , one thousand text messages per month , and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . Oh , and we also offer a rollover option ."

neutral,"No , thanks . I ’ Ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine ."
neutral,"Of course . We ’ Ve got this style here that is very popular . Because it ’ s an open-toe shoe , you can wear it any time of the year . They look great on everyone ."
neutral,Umm . too shiny . And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed-toe shoe .
neutral,"OK , these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable ."
neutral,I don ’ t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly .
neutral,Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !
neutral,"Oh yeah ? Tell me then , smarty pants , how will you go about setting up your garden ?"
neutral,What type of tools ?
neutral,I ’ ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . I ’ ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! Gardening all done !
neutral,"We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking ! This one for example , is a bi monthly publication with recipes from all over the world !"
neutral,"I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food , you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer ."
neutral,"I mean , in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food.So we miss the food in Taiwan too much.Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better ."
neutral,Even in the winter ?
neutral,"Well , this really is delicious , I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining ."
neutral,Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ?
neutral,"No , dim sum is more Cantonese style.But of course you can buy it in Taiwan ."
neutral,"Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time ."
neutral,"I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?"
neutral,What ?
neutral,"No , of course not . You have to put soap in . Did you bring your soap ?"
neutral,I can't believe it . How can that be ? How old are you ?
neutral,"Yes , my mother washed my clothes too.But when I was twelve , I started to wash clothes myself ."
neutral,I'm not laughing at you . But let me ask you something ?
neutral,"Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money ."
neutral,So what do you see in there ?
neutral,"No , I guess not . But that's what I want , isn't it ? An efficiency ."
neutral,That means the apartment has furniture in it .
neutral,"Sometimes it's good , sometimes it's bad . You have to like the furniture ."
neutral,This one . Two male grad students seeking roommate.Must be quiet . Comfortable downtown apartment.Does this mean I have to share a room with them ?
neutral,"Here's the number , 256-4367 ."
neutral,"Yes , I would like to buy a Walkman . Can you tell me about the models you have ?"
neutral,"Well , we have a lot of models here.Did you want to listen to CD's or cassettes or the radio ?"

neutral,I'm bleeding too much .
neutral,We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike .
neutral,Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .
neutral,"Well , do you have any for tomorrow ?"
neutral,"Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes ."
neutral,NO !
neutral,I haven't even told you what it is yet !
neutral,"Okay , okay , what do you want ?"
neutral,"Duh ! He's like the hottest and most popular guy at school ! Come on , dad ! Please !"
neutral,"Well , sir . You said you were looking at cars at the rental agency at the airport.Now with them you'd spend your money and get nothing for it.But you could probably rent this Porsche from us , for the same price as one of their standard cars ."
neutral,It really hurts .
neutral,Can I return the car in San Francisco ?
neutral,"Do you still want the car , sir ?"
neutral,"Just a moment , sir . We have to finish filling out the forms ."
neutral,"Good afternoon , sir , is there anything I can help you with today ?"
neutral,That purple one . I ’ m sorry ... I ’ Ve never bought jewellery for anyone and I ’ m kind of nervous .
neutral,So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work .
neutral,What are we going to do now ?
neutral,How many students are in the class ?
neutral,I'm sorry I scratched your car .
neutral,"May I have a look at that vase , please ?"
neutral,"Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive ."
neutral,Can you give me a hand with the dishes ?
neutral,How about this wallet ? It's made of fine leather .
neutral,What is it ?
neutral,"Here you are . sir , the chocolate cake is very delicious ."
neutral,Have you tried the Internet ?
neutral,All right .
neutral,"Ben , what are you doing ?"
neutral,You got me .
neutral,"Yeah . I met with them back in March , remember ?"
neutral,Right .
neutral,"Well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . Besides , you should let old people on first ."
neutral,"Oh , no ."
neutral,"It ’ s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A ."
neutral,"No , one thousand at least ."
neutral,"You ’ re a thief , Vicki . But I guess , eight hundred and fifty is all right ."
neutral,"Here you are , sucker !"
neutral,"Victory for me , I bought it for 30 bucks just yesterday !"
neutral,Then what about the wire ?
neutral,They ’ re all doing fine . Let me show you some of their pictures .
neutral,All my children are agile .
neutral,What for ?
neutral,Party ? What party ?
neutral,"Certainly , sir . How much rent did you want to pay ?"
neutral,"One moment please . Very well , Mr . Smith . I need to ask you a few questions ."
neutral,"No , it ’ s unfurnished . It has a kitchen , but there are not many cookers . There ’ s a garden in the back , but the tenants can ’ t use it . The landlord lives downstairs . Friends are forbidden in the apartment after midnight . No noise and no television after 11 ..."
neutral,The water wagon .
neutral,The road ahead is blocked . There might have been an accident .
neutral,"My shirt needs ironing . Could you please help me with that , Mary ?"
neutral,"Ok , what do you want me to do ?"
neutral,"While you ’ re cleaning the cooker , I ’ ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meat , by the way ."
neutral,Yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out .
neutral,"Very well . Why do you want to disconnect your phone , sir ?"
neutral,"No , thank you ."
neutral,"Then I have to call another taxi , or I'll be late ."
neutral,It ’ s quite large . It ’ s about 40 square meters .
neutral,Which one is cheaper ?
neutral,"Well , you already watch too much TV instead of doing your homework , anyway ."
neutral,"Well , that ’ s true , but you ’ d probably only watch cartoons and action movies ."
neutral,"Well , if everybody jumped off a bridge , would you jump too ?"
neutral,"Have you got the time , Tom ?"
neutral,Uh ... yeah . Hi ! Is Susie there ?
neutral,You must have dialed the wrong number .
neutral,"Hello . Mr . Higgins , please ."
neutral,B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown .
neutral,That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown .
neutral,"Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ?"
neutral,Yes . I need a belt that is kind of casual and kind of dressy .
neutral,But we'll be careful .
neutral,What ?
neutral,Look out ! A small boy is rushing out blindly .
neutral,"Gee , how dangerous ! I've almost knocked him down ."
neutral,"have you moved into your new house yet , Michael ?"
neutral,how old is the house then ?
neutral,do you have a big yard ?
neutral,how many rooms does your house have ?
neutral,Eh ?
neutral,The what ?
neutral,"What ? Speak up , Janey . I'm afraid I can't hear you ."
neutral,I'm hungry . Let's go to the snack bar .
neutral,what's that ?
neutral,I don't know . I don't know what most of this food is !
neutral,have you ever tried tempura ?
neutral,Believe I will . Look for me near the lake .
neutral,"Certainly , sir ."
neutral,The rent is $ 725 each month .
neutral,What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ?
neutral,The rent is $ 1050 each month .
neutral,How about if I pay $ 850 ?
neutral,"Italian , Indian and chinese . I ’ Ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and I need some more practice ."
neutral,"Not at all.You can find most of them in supermarkets.The ingredients are usually the same as in Western food.The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients ."
neutral,"Just a casual one - a sport jacket . This one looks nice . I ’ ll just try it on ... yes , that ’ s fine . I ’ ll take it . Here ’ s my credit card ."
neutral,Good morning . I ’ m thinking about buying some new furniture for my living room . Could you help me ?
neutral,Yes . The price has been reduced by 50 % . It ’ s a real bargain .
neutral,I ’ ll take it . I also need to improve the lighting in my living room . Do you have any suggestions ?
neutral,It is just too dark in here with so few windows .
neutral,"The kitchen may be large , but it doesn ’ t have any storage space ."
neutral,"Hi , can I speak with the apartment manager , please ?"
neutral,Are you free today at around 6 p . m . ?
neutral,"Yes , I will be able to make it then ."
neutral,I used to live in that area .
neutral,I'll give you an application form when I see you .
neutral,How are you today ?
neutral,You have to make an appointment first .
neutral,I would like to make one right now if I can .
neutral,Are you available this Friday ?
neutral,Can we do it at 6 o ’ clock ?
neutral,That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment .
neutral,You don ’ t have any problems with how it looks ?
neutral,"Actually , there is a problem ."
neutral,Like what ?
neutral,"Oh , is that right ?"
neutral,Everything ’ s fine with me .
neutral,Why can ’ t I view it today ?
neutral,How does this Friday sound ?
neutral,I do have one problem with the apartment .
neutral,We will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment .
neutral,I did not know that .
neutral,I would love to rent out your apartment .
neutral,How much is the rent ?
neutral,Can I require the owners to fix the problems ?
neutral,I could use some help on moving day . What are you doing on Saturday ?
neutral,I inspect the home for problems that might not be all that apparent in a quick walk-through .
neutral,"I found some fairly major problems . A major support beam in the roof is broken , and the shower floor leaked and rotted out the second-floor joist ."
neutral,"The carpet needs to be cleaned , and I want to paint the walls a different color ."
neutral,"Hello , I was wondering if I could talk with the apartment manager ."
neutral,"Yes , I would love to see the apartment ."
neutral,I will be at the apartment today at 6
neutral,I'll be bringing an application form .
neutral,I came in to see how my home inspection went .
neutral,"I had a home inspection before , but didn ’ t really understand it ."
neutral,I help you spot potential problems with the home before you purchase it .
neutral,"Sellers aren ’ t really all that objective . They may have gotten used to a leaky faucet , but it is still broken ."
neutral,"The current owners will be moving out on Tuesday , so technically you could pick up the keys and move in on Wednesday ."
neutral,That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too .
neutral,Did you buy new cupboards too ?
neutral,"I'd like to speak with the apartment manager , please ."
neutral,I have no problem with 6 p . m .
neutral,"ok . I ’ ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them . Where is the tea towel ? Oh , here it is ."
neutral,we ’ ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it .
neutral,yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out .
neutral,I ’ d like to have the bed and the wardrobe .
neutral,Everything in this magazine seems expensive . You could probably find something similar in a discount store .
neutral,I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it mys
neutral,What do we need for the barbecue ?
neutral,I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs.We ’ ll need some tomato catchup and some barbecue sauce .
neutral,"It only takes a few minutes.Some people like their meat well done , others like it rare.The great thing about the barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked ."
neutral,when did it first break down ?
neutral,"ok . I ’ ll start by looking at the motor . I ’ ll just unplug it and take a look inside the machine ... oh , yes . There ’ s the problem . It ’ s quite simple . I ’ ll sort it out in a few minutes ."
neutral,Which spices are you going to add to the meat ?
neutral,"These ones here.The one on the left is very spicy , so we must be careful about how much we add ."
neutral,"Cook it over a high flame , so that it will be ready quickly.Keep stirring the meat around the frying pan.Don ’ t let the meat stick to the bottom of the pan ."
neutral,No dessert for you unless you eat all of your vegetables .
neutral,"You can have some fruits for dessert.If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake ."
neutral,"I'll remember that for next time.You ’ ll get extra peas and carrots , but no broccoli or cauliflower , ok ?"
neutral,Can I have apple pie with ice cream ?
neutral,Rise and shine ! Sleepyhead !
neutral,"I know , I know . But I don't want any worms ."
neutral,For each month you would have to pay $ 1050 .
neutral,$ 850 a month is not enough money .
neutral,The local newspaper has ads for housing .
neutral,Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate .
neutral,"When you need an apartment , where do you look for one ?"
neutral,Some of the ads in the paper are from people looking for roommates .
neutral,Are apartments expensive in this city ?
neutral,You can get that type of apartment for around fifteen hundred dollars a month .
neutral,Would you have time to go look at apartments with me ?
neutral,You will have to pay $ 1050 every month .
neutral,I was thinking $ 800 a month .
neutral,I can live with that .
neutral,How did you find your apartment ?
neutral,You can check on the bulletin boards at school for local housing .
neutral,It depends on what you want . Do you want a one - or two-bedroom apartment ?
neutral,That will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month .
neutral,I ’ m renting this apartment out for $ 1050 a month .
neutral,That is quite a lot of money for just one month .
neutral,That is a fair price .
neutral,I want to hear more about this apartment .
neutral,All you really need to know is that the apartment looks great .
neutral,What ? Oh shit ! I cut my finger .
neutral,Dai Ling .
neutral,"Yes , your number is out of service ."
neutral,"It's a serious problem . I make expecting an important call . The theater is guilty . It supposed to call me this evening , and discuss my play . What were happened if they can't reach me ?"
neutral,What kinds of meat are most popular in your country ?
neutral,"Yes , what would you recommend ?"
neutral,"I'm happy to recommend the fish , It testes delicious , and it is today's special . Our chef is from the coast , and love seafood . Today special is actually his favorite dish . so I'm sure it is a"
neutral,What size would you like ?
neutral,Which kind do you want ?
neutral,I like seafood on my pizza .
neutral,We have two seafood pizzas . Tuna and crab .
neutral,Would that be for here or take away ?
neutral,"That'll be in a ten minutes . Please sit over there , and I'll call you over as sooner as it's ready ."
neutral,Can I help you ?
neutral,"That's not a problem , Miss . Will that be it ?"
neutral,"That will be 25RMB , please"
neutral,"Yes , I ’ m . Are you French , too ?"
neutral,I ’ m Italian . Are you a teacher ?
neutral,"My hat ’ s new , too ."
neutral,Who is this young man ?
neutral,"Give me some glasses please , Jane ."
neutral,These ?
neutral,"Be careful . Don ’ t drop it ! Don ’ t put it there , Sam . Put it here , on this shelf ."
neutral,How are you today ?
neutral,"Yes , please ."
neutral,What did you need to talk about ?
neutral,I have some questions about my lease .
neutral,What will happen if I move out before then ?
neutral,Can we talk ?
neutral,In three years your lease will be up .
neutral,Why would you keep it ?
neutral,I would keep it because you would be breaking our contract .
neutral,"I would like to talk to you , if you have time ."
neutral,I want to discuss some things about my lease .
neutral,How much do you think the rent will be ?
neutral,I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
neutral,"I know it's old , but what make is it ?"
neutral,Would you like to look at my cousin's car ?
neutral,It's a coupe with a vinyl roof .
neutral,"it would be better for the environment , too ."
neutral,"yes , we are . obviously , we'd like something as cheap as possible . we've heard that there are places for 80 to 100 pounds a month ."
neutral,"yes , there are several place available in that price range near the university . do you have any other requirements ?"
neutral,of course . i'm not very busy at the moment . if you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes . i can take you there .
neutral,I like this apartment . Do you think we can afford the mortgage ?
neutral,do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?
neutral,I'll go with you . Where is she ?
neutral,"she's on the M40 , near Reading ."
neutral,is that your rabbit ?
neutral,"well , i wanted to get a pet that wouldn't disturb the neighbors . at the same time , I wanted a pet that would be affectionate ."
neutral,"if you cuddle them a lot when they are very young , they can be just as affectionate as dogs or cats ."
neutral,i was just opening up an attachment in an email about winning the lottery .
neutral,has your computer turned back on yet ?
neutral,"fortunately , I saved my work right before it crashed , so it should be OK ."
neutral,"yes , doesn't everyone ?"
neutral,have you ever had a dog ?
neutral,when do most children start school in your country ?
neutral,how many subjects do they have to study ?
neutral,"In most schools , they study about nine subjects ."
neutral,"some private schools require their students to wear uniforms , but public schools don't ."
neutral,did you go to a public school or a private school ?
neutral,Why do you need running shoes ? You aren't a runner .
neutral,What's the difference ?
neutral,"That's right.If you want a really lightweight shoe , you should buy a high-quality running shoe ."
neutral,My sister has New Balance running shoes . I want shoes just like hers . I don't care if they're expensive . And they look cool too .
neutral,"Yes , that's it . That's their top model ."
neutral,what are you going to try first ?
neutral,do they serve the yogurt with anything ?
neutral,I believe they add locally produced honey to it .
neutral,what do you think ? How does it taste ?
neutral,what do you think ? Does it taste good ?
neutral,do you know where they are from .
neutral,My brother has last year's Accord.And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord .
neutral,I don't like shopping in malls . I like shopping on the street . There is more variety .
neutral,I don't know . Let me look on the rack . Here is one . LARGE . Try it on .
neutral,I look like a nerd .
neutral,Alright . Alright .
neutral,"You should be happy I want you to look good.If I let you shop for yourself , you would never buy anything ."
neutral,Could you tell me now some of the things I need to do ?
neutral,"Then , after you sand it , you use tack cloth to wipe off any dust or sawdust ."
neutral,Sawdust ?
neutral,That makes sense .
neutral,It only sounds complicated . It's really very easy . A lot of people here in America finish their own furniture.It ' s a good way to save some money . And a lot of people even enjoy it .
neutral,"Well , I will look around your shop some more . I need to think about it ."
neutral,Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too.Do you have a color chart I can look at ?
neutral,We have a very wide selection of colors.And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin.So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ?
neutral,What should I get Uncle Teddy ?
neutral,Everybody gets men ties for Christmas . It's too boring . Everybody buys either ties or sweaters . I want a more unique gift .
neutral,What should he have then ?
neutral,I don't think this mall has a leather goods store.So we have to go to State Street .
neutral,Alright . We can go check at Sears and see if they have them.And what about Dad ?
neutral,A tie ?
neutral,"I would like to make a suggestion then , sir ."
neutral,Please do .
neutral,"For one thing , sir , the quality of the image is usually better.That ' s because it's digital ."
neutral,"So let me show you some of our DVD players.In my opinion , DVD is the wave of the future ."
neutral,"Hello . Is Becky there , please ?"
neutral,"She ’ s in the garden , Jane ."
neutral,"Yes , he is . He ’ s climbing the tree ."
neutral,"Excuse me , can I order now , please ?"
neutral,Sure and which one would you like ?
neutral,"Yes , I do ."
neutral,"Yes , please ."
neutral,"What are you going to do now , George ?"
neutral,"I can see the teapot , but I can ’ t see the tea ."
neutral,"Hurry up , Sam . The kettle ’ s boiling ."
neutral,Do you have any shoes like these ?
neutral,What colour ?
neutral,Did she buy them here ?
neutral,"No , she bought them in the U . S ."
neutral,"We had some shoes like those a month ago , but we don't have any now ."
neutral,What about some steak ? This is a nice piece .
neutral,"Give me that piece please , and a pond of meet , too ."
neutral,"To tell you the truth Mrs . Bird , I don't like chicken , either !"
neutral,Did he telephone again last night ?
neutral,Did he telephone again ?
neutral,"Yes , of course . Come in ."
neutral,How long have you lived here ?
neutral,I have lived here for twenty years .
neutral,How much does this house cost ?
neutral,Women always have the last word .
neutral,"Well , first let's consider your computer.Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3.It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory ."
neutral,Just a haircut . I washed my hair this morning .
neutral,Yes .
neutral,Of course . I have one I can suggest .
neutral,The problem is the split ends .
neutral,We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments .
neutral,What do you mean ?
neutral,"Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them ."
neutral,It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .
neutral,"you know , foreigners are not expected to use chopsticks proficiently . If you do , you'll give your Chinese friends quite an impression ."
neutral,"And as for the kitchen things , do you want very high quality ?"
neutral,What do you mean ?
neutral,"I have never shopped there , but I think Price Club is a kind of membership store ."
neutral,"I'm not sure.But if you are only going to stay a year , I don't think Price Club is good to join.They have great deals occasionally.They are very good for people who like to buy new things all"
neutral,And why are you returning them ?
neutral,I know many stores have that policy . But I have returned sale items here before .
neutral,Please show me your receipt again .
neutral,"I will have to give you store credit , Ma'am . If you find something else you like in the store , you can use the credit ."
neutral,I was just wondering if many Chinese people take their leftover food home from a restaurant .
neutral,"no , that's OK . You know what they say when in Rome ..."
neutral,"many people in my generation don't eat pig's feet , but my parents grew up eating them , so I think they are OK ."
neutral,"do you like cooking , Julia ?"
neutral,"aside from the Sunday roast , we usually eat dangers and mash , toad-in-the-hole , or fish'n chips once a week ."
neutral,what's your favorite dish to make ?
neutral,"I don't really like coffee , to be honest . It's too bitter for me ."
neutral,"well , you need something to wake you up . How about a soda ?"
neutral,"unfortunately , it doesn't . how about some diet coke ?"
neutral,maybe you should try a cappuccino or a latte ; they taste much better than plain brewed coffee .
neutral,"I bought all the ingredients this morning , so let's start !"
neutral,what do we do first ?
neutral,"first , you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces ."
neutral,that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stir-fried on its own until its cooked through .
neutral,how about the rice ?
neutral,I'll prepare it . Do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
neutral,the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
neutral,automatics are very simple to drive . The first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
neutral,that ’ s better . Now what ?
neutral,the tank is almost empty . I guess I ’ ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up .
neutral,I got it . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll get you there in one piece .
neutral,we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . The same designs can be found on these posters .
neutral,"I'll take it , I'd also like to buy some chocolate ."
neutral,"Come on , Let's go for lunch , Gregory ."
neutral,I'm starving . Let's go grab a bite .
neutral,"I got a replace my party outfit , I trashed it last week ."
neutral,"it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ’ ll probably be about an hour ’ s wait ."
neutral,I need 30 for my Christmas cards .
neutral,do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ?
neutral,"personally , I quite like the new perfume by Clinique . It's a subtle flowery scent . What do you think ?"
neutral,I know what she would like---some whitening cream .
neutral,ok . How about some lamb kebabs ?
neutral,can you help me pick out some fabric for a suit ? I'm going to get one made for a friend's wedding .
neutral,"that will probably be quite expensive , but the more you pay for the fabric , the longer it'll last and the better it'll look . What color do you want the suit to be ?"
neutral,I was thinking of a brown pin-striped suit .
neutral,"brown , huh ? Isn't that a bit dull ?"
neutral,"why don't you just get black ? Black suits are always fashionable and can be worn for anything — a funeral , a wedding , a job interview — anything !"
neutral,"that may be true , but black is so boring . Anyway , I already have three black suits . I might as well get a suit that stands out from the rest ."
neutral,I think that will do . Let's go talk to the tailor about getting it made .
neutral,don't you think it ’ s a bit bright ?
neutral,"yeah , maybe you ’ re right . How about this outfit ?"
neutral,"that dress looks lovely on you , but it ’ s not very practical , is it ?"
neutral,"how about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ?"
neutral,yep . Here it is . What do you think ?
neutral,my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
neutral,"I see . Well , I can help with the chores while I ’ m here . You two could probably use my help ."
neutral,I can ask around at work . Do you have a preference for makers or non-smokers ?
neutral,"I ’ d prefer non-smoking roommates , but I guess I ’ ll have to take what I can get !"
neutral,I don't think I can afford that .
neutral,The large one .
neutral,"ok , so what have you got in store for me tonight ?"
neutral,"' going Dutch ' means to split the bill , silly !"
neutral,Don't feel like it . I'm broke .
neutral,"Yes , go straight along Beijing Road and turn right ."
neutral,have you thought of moving at all Sarah ?
neutral,like what ?
neutral,"it was about 75 years old . There were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time ."
neutral,"the area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it ’ s ok ."
neutral,"well , we could go to the newsagent ’ s to pick up the Sunday paper , go to the butcher ’ s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist ’ s to pick up your prescription from the doctor ."
neutral,"oh , Iris ! what was it about this time ?"
neutral,"oh , she keeps saying that . She never allows me to have them ."
neutral,"me , too . What did you have in mind ?"
neutral,"oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ?"
neutral,"oh , that suits you very well . Besides it is believed in China that the red color brings happiness and good luck ."
neutral,how about the Mongolian hot pot ?
neutral,the chef is going to slice it into thin pieces . There will be around one hundred and twenty pieces of both skin and meat for each .
neutral,"absolutely . It is said that they serve 3,000 ducks every day ."
neutral,You didn't see the red light ?
neutral,I know that .
neutral,Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light .
neutral,Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light .
neutral,"The market is fairly down right now , so the offer is a realistic one ."
neutral,When will we know if they accept the offer ?
neutral,Start the car .
neutral,Take a left .
neutral,Are you aware of all the controls in the car ?
neutral,"Call me tomorrow , and we'll get started ."
neutral,Did you bring your ticket ?
neutral,Did you bring your ID ?
neutral,What do you need my ID for ?
neutral,"Yes , everything will be cleared ."
neutral,Isn't it past your bedtime already ?
neutral,You'll be up all night if I let you do that .
neutral,"Actually , we are famous for our Cuervo Gold margaritas ."
neutral,I need help turning them on .
neutral,Everything on it ?
neutral,Your total comes to $ 5.48 .
neutral,I'd like to make an appointment right now .
neutral,What day are you available ?
neutral,How about Saturday ?
neutral,Can you come over at 11
neutral,We can make a number of mixed drinks at our bar .
neutral,Whatever meal that you plan on making .
neutral,Your food tastes so much better than mine .
neutral,So you're telling me that you want me to make dinner ?
neutral,I'm going to go rest for a little bit .
neutral,"I'll come wake you when it's ready , okay ?"
neutral,Where should we go eat today ?
neutral,"Trust me , the food isn't half bad ."
neutral,Can you go to the store for me ?
neutral,I'm starving ! It would be truly appreciated if you bought me a burrito .
neutral,"Okay , so on Friday , you can buy yourself something to eat ."
neutral,"I can't go home yet , because I have things to do here ."
neutral,We can eat at the cafeteria .
neutral,Is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ?
neutral,They have really good chow mein .
neutral,Do you want to know what kind of pie I like ?
neutral,I'm probably going to buy something too .
neutral,What kind do you want ?
neutral,What are you thinking of getting ?
neutral,I go to Sons for my groceries .
neutral,"Yes , that's the place to go to get healthier food ."
neutral,"If you like Sons , then I'm sure you'll love Whole Foods ."
neutral,You can always make an easy breakfast .
neutral,"I sometimes run late in the morning , and can't make breakfast ."
neutral,"I just eat some oatmeal , toast , and orange juice ."
neutral,"So , are you still going to have cereal ?"
neutral,I don't have any idea what to cook .
neutral,Can you tell me how to make it ?
neutral,What else do I have to do ?
neutral,I really want to make something for dinner .
neutral,I haven't the slightest clue what I'm going to make .
neutral,All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef .
neutral,"I changed my diet recently , and I eat a lot healthier now ."
neutral,Have you ever been shopping at Whole Foods ?
neutral,I know what you mean . I've started eating better myself .
neutral,"I tend to stick to fruits , vegetables , and chicken ."
neutral,Those are the only things you eat ?
neutral,Why aren't you eating anything else ?
neutral,"Well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy ."
neutral,What kind of food do you usually eat ?
neutral,That's basically it .
neutral,How do you stick to only those foods ?
neutral,You're supposed to always have a hearty breakfast .
neutral,What do you have for breakfast ?
neutral,Why don't you make me some oatmeal and toast ?
neutral,I ate pizza the other day .
neutral,What do you feel like having ?
neutral,Tell me what you want to eat .
neutral,How about I get pizza and you get a burger ?
neutral,Where do they sell both at ?
neutral,They sell pizza and burgers at the cafeteria .
neutral,I'm still hungry .
neutral,I think I will do that .
neutral,I'm going to get a snack .
neutral,You can always make a sandwich .
neutral,Just make yourself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich .
neutral,I can tell you what kind I like .
neutral,I wouldn't mind a burger .
neutral,"You could always get a burger , and I can get a pizza ."
neutral,I don't understand what you mean .
neutral,I would like to get a double cheeseburger .
neutral,"Sure , how about a medium Pepsi ?"
neutral,I was planning on making some kind of vegetable .
neutral,I wouldn't mind eating some corn .
neutral,What do you mean ?
neutral,"I can boil it , grill it , or microwave it ."
neutral,You just ate .
neutral,I have no idea what kind of sandwich I want to make .
neutral,A PB & J is pretty easy to make .
neutral,Did you forget to put anything on the list ?
neutral,Would you like me to go anywhere else for you ?

neutral,Please bring our salads to us now . We are hungry !

neutral,Trust me . I'm going to wake up .
neutral,I want you to be on time for school today .
neutral,I'd like to have internet on my computer .

neutral,My rear bumper is messed up .
neutral,What did happen ?
neutral,Me too .
neutral,Are they going to be okay ?
neutral,I think so .
neutral,"Well , that's a miracle that no one was killed ."
neutral,"I'm sorry , I didn't even notice it ."
neutral,I can understand why you didn't stop for it .
neutral,"Under the circumstances , I think I'm just going to let you go with a warning ."
neutral,I stopped you for driving through a red light .
neutral,I'll have to write you a ticket .
neutral,"If I saw the stop sign , I would've stopped for it ."
neutral,What's the problem ?
neutral,I only saw bushes at the intersection .
neutral,Those bushes are covering the stop sign .
neutral,"No , I'm just going to let you go ."
neutral,"Weren't you taught that yellow means slow down , not speed up ?"
neutral,I did learn that .
neutral,"So , then why did you speed up ?"
neutral,I understand .
neutral,Here you go . Don't do that again .
neutral,The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar .
neutral,Where do I put the change ?
neutral,Could you tell me how to use the washer and dryer ?
neutral,Do you have any change ?
neutral,You need to put 50 cents into the washer machine and a dollar into the dryer .
neutral,That's everything .
neutral,I'm here if you need any more help .
neutral,I can't wash at home because my machine is broken .
neutral,I have been washing clothes here since a few years ago .
neutral,Why are you washing your clothes here now ?
neutral,My washing machine broke down .
neutral,"I would , if my washing machine wasn't broken ."
neutral,I can't afford it .
neutral,I know . I am still going to clean it up .
neutral,I won't forget .
neutral,I don't want you to leave until you clean up .
neutral,I haven't gotten started on my room yet .
neutral,I have every intention of cleaning my room later .
neutral,I'll remember to do that .
neutral,I'll clean my room before I leave .
neutral,Do you know what package you want to get ?
neutral,What packages do you have ?
neutral,"Okay , I'll make dinner tonight ."
neutral,Do you have a package that includes all the movie channels with the basic channels also ?
neutral,Do you want anything else ?

neutral,What was your call about ?
neutral,Did he do something wrong ?
neutral,You can accept this offer or decline it and come up with another offer .
neutral,"If I make another offer and they refuse , then what ?"
neutral,"I was able to contact them so , if you ’ ll step into my office , we ’ ll talk ."
neutral,I want to take a look at that home with the Open House flags out front .
neutral,How many days do I need to finish the course ?
neutral,Is that all ?
neutral,I'd like to come in tomorrow morning at 9
neutral,"Yes , it is on our list ."
neutral,"Oh look , they have some refreshments in here ."
neutral,"With so few windows , how can you even see what the problems are ?"
neutral,Is there a dead animal somewhere in here ?

neutral,"Yes , you passed ."
neutral,Do you think we can go driving right now ?
neutral,"Yeah , sure . Let's go ."
neutral,Make a left on this next street .
neutral,Do you think you can teach me ?
neutral,I have it already .
neutral,I've only done it once .
neutral,When do you want to start learning how to drive ?
neutral,We can do it tomorrow ; just call me .
neutral,Your assistant said that it was time to come in and sign my escrow papers .
neutral,Should I have brought anything with me ?
neutral,My boyfriend is an attorney and told me that I could fax him anything if I had a question .
neutral,Please get any outside help that you need in understanding your escrow documents .
neutral,"At the close of escrow , the house will be yours !"
neutral,"So , when are you going to inform the owners of my acceptance ?"
neutral,I have been studying .
neutral,All right . Do you know if the test covers the whole book ?
neutral,"After the owners get home from work tonight , I will approach them with your offer ."
neutral,When can I take my test ?
neutral,"Yes , I do ."
neutral,Can I take the test again ?
neutral,You'll be able to take the test again in a couple weeks .

neutral,"Okay , here's my ID and the $ 27 ."
neutral,Do you have your ID with you ?
neutral,I may have left my ID in my car .
neutral,Do you want the truth ?
neutral,What were they ?
neutral,Did you buckle your seatbelt ?
neutral,What do you want me to do ?
neutral,Go left .
neutral,Tell me before you want me to stop .
neutral,You failed .
neutral,"You do know all the controls in the car , don't you ?"
neutral,Here's my ticket right here .
neutral,I'm going to need to see your ID .
neutral,You can't pay your fine without your ID .
neutral,We have to make sure that the person issued the ticket is the one paying it .
neutral,Only if you pay your fine .
neutral,Have you paid all your tickets off ?
neutral,That's not cheap at all .
neutral,I got a parking ticket the other day .
neutral,"No , have you ?"
neutral,The ticket was for parking in the red zone .
neutral,I parked in front of my apartment building .
neutral,What about your parking spot ?
neutral,"Yes , I have my ticket with me ."
neutral,"Okay , I think I understand ."
neutral,Have you paid off your parking tickets ?
neutral,"Yes , I paid my fines ."
neutral,"If I remember correctly , it's about $ 130 ."
neutral,Did you ever get a parking ticket ?
neutral,Of course I have .
neutral,You should probably pay the fine soon .
neutral,I got a ticket yesterday .
neutral,I got a ticket a couple of days ago .
neutral,Why would you park in the red zone ?
neutral,Could you tell me where the dishwashing detergent is ?
neutral,You'll find that by the paper towels .

neutral,Very well . We have some fresh red roses .
neutral,"No , the roses will be fine ."
neutral,There are six on this table .
neutral,Many people like the dancing figures . Two of our boxes have the figures .
neutral,So hard to choose . I think I'll take this one .
neutral,That ’ s not going to be all right .
neutral,"Well , that's reasonable . I'll take it ."
neutral,Why can ’ t you give it back to me ?
neutral,I ’ m going to need my deposit back .
neutral,"I can ’ t stay here , though ."
neutral,"You can keep the apartment if you stay caught up on your rent . Otherwise , I need to find someone who can make the payments ."
neutral,I mentioned to you before that you need to keep up with your rent . This notice to evict is letting you know that I mean business .
neutral,"I received an eviction notice from you , and I don ’ t understand what it means ."
neutral,You have been late with your rent several times now . I am filing suit for back rent to protect myself .
neutral,Are you throwing me out ?
neutral,I have to move .
neutral,There ’ s a problem with that .
neutral,I won ’ t be able to give you back your deposit .
neutral,I can ’ t do that .
neutral,I can help you . How much money do you make per year ?
neutral,I think that it is around 600 .
neutral,The best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom .
neutral,I would like to pick a time to look at houses with you .
neutral,I have been at my current job for 10 years .
neutral,I try not to think about it !
neutral,There is a formula that can help us figure that out . What is your annual salary ?
neutral,Do you receive any other income ?
neutral,"Sure , would you prefer looking in the morning or afternoon ?"
neutral,"Can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ?"
neutral,"We could meet at the real estate office , or I could pick you up at your home ."
neutral,"Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new ."
neutral,There you go .
neutral,I think I'll use my credit card .
neutral,"Your signature here , please , and we're finished ."
neutral,We have nothing on sale today . But we're having a big sale next weekend .
neutral,Is the sale going to include dresses ?
neutral,Let me use my credit card .
neutral,"Hello , where can I buy an inexpensive cashmere sweater ?"
neutral,Outlets usually give you great deals .
neutral,Have you tried an outlet ?
neutral,"I'm looking for the produce section , please ."
neutral,All of the produce is in aisle A .
neutral,Do you know what produce is on sale ?
neutral,Where can I find the produce ?
neutral,What sales do they have today ?
neutral,I'm sure something is on sale . Please check with the produce person .
neutral,"You do realize that I will need to rip down your wall to get to the pipe , right ?"
neutral,I ’ ll get started on it now .
neutral,It ’ s my job . What can I help you with ?
neutral,That's because you did well .
neutral,Why ?
neutral,Can you eat the stone ?
neutral,How much are these mangoes ?
neutral,"Well , how much are they ?"
neutral,"They usually taste sweet , but they remind me of an orange ."

neutral,"I have to see a sample . Bring me one this week , please ."
neutral,That won ’ t be a problem ?
neutral,"Sure , go ahead ."
neutral,How do you get along with the American students in your classes ?
neutral,Did you just arrive in this country ? You look a little nervous .
neutral,I fell asleep very late . It was almost two o ’ clock in the morning when I finally fell asleep .
neutral,Do you mind if I ask you a question ? If it ’ s too personal you can forget it .
neutral,"Have you got a scholarship , or are you on your own ?"
neutral,I have a scholarship from my government for four years . How about you ?
neutral,I have a tuition scholarship from the university . Otherwise I ’ m on my own .
neutral,"I disagree with you . They don ’ t all wear the same clothes ; they ’ re definitely not all blond ; they don ’ t all own Parker fountain pens ; they don ’ t all drink Coca Cola , and they don ’ t all chew gum . I do think they all drive cars though ! But that doesn ’ t have anything to do with how they look !"
neutral,"More or less . I go to three different buildings , and always get there late . I feel so hopeless . I don ’ t know why I am late all the time . No one else seems to be ."
neutral,I don ’ t know anything about it . Soccer isn ’ t as popular in my country as it is here .
neutral,"I ’ ll come down and watch you play some day , and see what it ’ s like ."
neutral,Tax brings your total to $ 32.42 . How would you like to pay ?
neutral,"Cash , please ."
neutral,"Yes , she needs something to help her at school ."
neutral,This is a gift she'll cherish for years . How do you want to pay ?
neutral,"In fact , she prefers Macs . How much is one ?"
neutral,"It's all yours after you sign here , please ."
neutral,Might I suggest a Mac ?
neutral,"Well , a 15 - inch Pro is $ 2,100 ."
neutral,"Let me ring you up . Okay , sign here , please ."
neutral,"Well , I've never heard of a little girl that didn't love Barbie dolls ."
neutral,"Sure . Wait , wait . Does a lid come with this pan ?"
neutral,I want to find an old music box .
neutral,"Now , is there any warranty with this ?"
neutral,I'd appreciate it if you could help me pick out a gift for my daughter .
neutral,A Mac would be an excellent gift .
neutral,Will she need anything besides what's in this box ?
neutral,"Well , I cook a lot of big meals ."
neutral,What do you think of this one ? It's a 16 ” pan .
neutral,Hi . I'm looking for some good deals on produce .
neutral,Tell me what they taste like .
neutral,I am looking for a pan .
neutral,"Oh , yes , this is much better . But it has an aluminum handle ."
neutral,"Yes , it's very lightweight . But I don't want this aluminum handle ."
neutral,"We had seven , but we sold one this morning ."
neutral,"Now , does this come with a warranty ?"
neutral,Exactly how old a box do you want ?
neutral,Dancing figures are quite popular . Two of the boxes have them .
neutral,"No . But if something goes wrong with it , I know someone who repairs these things ."
neutral,$ 20 a dozen .
neutral,"No , I'll just give her the roses and a card ."
neutral,I need to buy some flowers for my wife .
neutral,What would the roses cost me ?
neutral,"No , the roses are good enough ."
neutral,I have to do some shopping .
neutral,I'm not sure .
neutral,You don't know ?
neutral,Would you like me to tell you where I got mine .
neutral,"They're not cheap , but neither is their furniture ."
neutral,What are you unhappy with ?
neutral,"Bring me a paint sample to look at , and I will consider it ."
neutral,I'm going to have to do some shopping today .
neutral,I would like to discuss purchasing a home with you .
neutral,I can help you . What location are you looking for ?
neutral,We would like a smaller cozy cottage with 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom .
neutral,Is living in a particular school district important to you ?
neutral,"Are you interested in purchasing on the lake , or would you like a home with a view ?"
neutral,"Now that I have an idea of what you want , I can begin my search ."
neutral,What size house would you like ?
neutral,Would you like a home near the lake or would you prefer a view ?
neutral,I would love to have a home with a view .
neutral,I would be willing to put in a different color carpet if you pay the price difference .
neutral,Is there any water damage ?
neutral,I ’ ll just do it myself .
neutral,Are you okay with me calling a plumber ?
neutral,That ’ s fine .
neutral,I ’ m having a problem .
neutral,"So , I can call someone to fix it ?"
neutral,Go right ahead .
neutral,We sent you an e-mail the first week we moved in ; it listed the problems we found .
neutral,What problems did you find ?
neutral,I don ’ t really consider any of that to be my responsibility . You can fix those things yourself .
neutral,Don't you know ?
neutral,"I have never been on this bus , but I'm sure it's the right one ."
neutral,"Next time , I'll look for the bus myself ."
neutral,There ’ s a leaking faucet in the sink .
neutral,You need to fix it .
neutral,I can ’ t right now .
neutral,I won ’ t rent it if the faucet isn ’ t fixed .
neutral,Where do you think you have problems ?
neutral,"You know , no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before ."
neutral,It should go to Altadena .
neutral,What do you mean it should ?
neutral,So why aren't you driving it ?
neutral,I know .
neutral,I'm not sure .
neutral,"Yeah , we did miss it ."
neutral,I think we have a while longer .
neutral,Are you sure we weren't supposed to get off already ?
neutral,I wasn't really paying attention . I think we missed our stop .
neutral,"Yeah , we definitely missed our stop ."
neutral,You could always take the 264 .
neutral,It goes all the way there .
neutral,Do you know what street it goes on ?
neutral,There's a stop right next to the mall ?
neutral,"We still have more to go , I think ."
neutral,I'm positive that we missed our stop .
neutral,Does this bus really go to the mall ?
neutral,Do you need help with something ?
neutral,What makes is so great ?
neutral,"We just got one in yesterday , so now we have six ."
neutral,"Yes , we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures ."
neutral,"Oh , no . Everything we sell here is ‘ as is . '"
neutral,I guess I was asking for too much .
neutral,It's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances .
neutral,"Now that I think of it , three days is better than seven ."
neutral,I need to purchase some business cards .
neutral,Great . Your order will take only one week .
neutral,"You know , I think it would be better if I could pick it up in three days ."
neutral,"Not only is it affordable , but it comes with all the appliances ."
neutral,What are the appliances .
neutral,"It has an ice maker , water dispenser , and plenty of room on the inside ."
neutral,"You need to fill out this form , please ."
neutral,"... Okay , I'm finished . Here's your form and my old card ."
neutral,"Very good , sir . Your order will be ready in one week ."
neutral,"No problem , sir . But it will cost you extra ."
neutral,"If you detect any difference , I'll take you out to dinner ."
neutral,"I need it sooner . Let me have it in three days , okay ?"
neutral,You should just ask the bus driver for a transfer .
neutral,"Dude , where are we at ?"
neutral,I thought this was the right stop .
neutral,"Yeah , get off the bus ."
neutral,I know.Do you have some change I can borrow ?
neutral,Why don't you have any money for another bus ?
neutral,"Anyway , do you have any change I can use for the bus ?"
neutral,I don't have any .
neutral,I don't know how I'm going to get home .
neutral,It doesn't cost anything .
neutral,I don't know .
neutral,I really don't feel like walking .
neutral,We could always wait for the next bus to come .
neutral,I would like to get a bus pass .
neutral,Can you tell me my options ?
neutral,I would like the student pass .
neutral,Here you go .
neutral,"The monthly sticker is $ 24 , but the actual pass is free ."
neutral,What street do I go to to catch it ?
neutral,Is there a bus in Altadena that'll take me to downtown LA ?
neutral,The 486 really goes downtown ?
neutral,How long is the bus ride ?
neutral,Is that right ?
neutral,"Yeah , it's not that long of a trip ."
neutral,It starts getting more crowded the closer you get to LA .
neutral,"Okay , which ones do I need to take ?"
neutral,Will that bus really take me to LA ?
neutral,It's a forty-five minute to an hour ride .
neutral,It doesn't take long at all
neutral,You get off on Del Mar and Hill .
neutral,I believe so .
neutral,Do you know which direction it should be heading ?
neutral,You need to get off on the corner of Del Mar and Hill .
neutral,You'll have to catch two different buses to get there .
neutral,What do I do after I get on the 268 ?
neutral,Catch the 261 and get off at Sons .
neutral,That's all you have to do .
neutral,"I will be coming by around 10 this morning . If you aren ’ t there , I ’ ll just use my key ."
neutral,I will not be home .
neutral,The faucet in the kitchen is leaking .
neutral,I don ’ t understand what the big deal is .
neutral,What you would like me to do about it ?
neutral,"Are you on the top floor , or is there another apartment above you ?"
neutral,We are on the top floor .
neutral,"Fine . If you do end up going somewhere , we can just use our pass key ."
neutral,Was it leaking in the bedroom ?
neutral,It was in the living room .
neutral,I'm going to go and get it right now .
neutral,I'm splendid . How about yourself ?
neutral,You have your own vehicle ?
neutral,"Hi , I need to talk with the property manager right away !"
neutral,This is the property manager . What seems to be the problem ?
neutral,I will be sending the assistant manager to check it out . May we look at it this morning ?
neutral,"Not much , I have a car ."
neutral,"So , you have your own car ?"
neutral,"Then , why are you on the bus with me ?"
neutral,It should take us back up to Altadena .
neutral,I'm not really sure if it does or not .
neutral,"That's true , and we have been on this bus for a while ."
neutral,For how much ?
neutral,I'll make sure to get it tomorrow .
neutral,How much for a bus pass ?
neutral,Is there anything else that doesn't cost as much ?
neutral,That actual bus pass is free .
neutral,The only thing you'll have to pay for is the monthly sticker .
neutral,It's only $ 24 a month .
neutral,"It's just a waste of cash , man !"
neutral,That sounds like a good deal .
neutral,I will .
neutral,How do you figure that ?
neutral,You want to buy one now ?
neutral,You get your bus pass ?
neutral,I think it's a waste of money .
neutral,You should go get yours .
neutral,"Yeah , I think I will ."
neutral,I don't want cheese on it .
neutral,What else would you like ?
neutral,I need to find the cereal aisle .
neutral,It's by the oatmeal and breakfast bars .
neutral,"Actually , I do need to find the dishwashing detergent ."
neutral,That would be over by the paper towels and toilet paper .
neutral,"Yeah , you'll find it there ."
neutral,What did you get for lunch today ?
neutral,"I enjoyed it , even though I had not asked for it ."
neutral,I'm going to need extra lean ground beef .
neutral,Could you point me toward the dishwashing detergent ?
neutral,"I got a sandwich , some chips , and a soda ."
neutral,"Considering it wasn't what I ordered , it was still pretty good ."
neutral,Would you like cheese on that ?
neutral,"No , thank you ."
neutral,What kind of soda would you like ?
neutral,Will that be all ?
neutral,What kind do you want ?
neutral,I'd like a Sprite .
neutral,What kind do you need ?
neutral,That sounds good .
neutral,"Altogether , it's going to be $ 12.15 ."
neutral,I need to get some beef .
neutral,I want to get some ground beef .
neutral,I would like four pounds of ground beef .
neutral,What kind of ground beef do you need ?
neutral,Go make that list .

neutral,The food there is actually pretty good .
neutral,"Could you do it for me , and write out a list of things that we need ?"
neutral,Like what ?
neutral,"Fine , I'll go do that for you ."
neutral,What are you going to buy ?
neutral,Go and look in the kitchen .
neutral,"You can get a burger , or some Chinese food . Or maybe you can get some Mexican food ."
neutral,I wouldn't mind getting some Chinese food .
neutral,Let me give you a hand . You are carrying so many books .
neutral,But I hear that the card is free .
neutral,"Yes , if the card is well kept and has no dirt and scratches ."
neutral,"Mary , I've some bad news for you ."

neutral,A laptop is a type of computer that you can carry with you . Do you understand ?
neutral,"Yes , that's right . That's very good ."
neutral,How's Jerry's new school ?
neutral,Mary didn't pass the final exam in physics .

neutral,You are right .
neutral,I want to enrich my knowledge in management . The United States is an ideal place for me .
neutral,Do you feel your English is good enough for the course ?
neutral,Do you have any advice ?
neutral,"Uh , when you live off campus , there might be a certain amount of flexibility in choosing roommates that you might not have when living on campus ."
neutral,What's your major in college ?
neutral,Mr . Rogers probably forgot to assign a locker to you .
neutral,Do we have to type out our homework ?
neutral,Mr . : No . You only do that when you write reports .
neutral,"Mr . : For those of you who don't have a calculator , get one ."
neutral,We are allowed to use a calculator in class ?
neutral,Wait . We have to return to our homeroom and wait to be dismissed .
neutral,Yeah . I'm going to my locker to get my jacket . Catch you later .
neutral,"Ms . : With a hall pass , you can go to the ladies ' room or wherever you need to go during class time ."
neutral,OK . ( Several minutes later . ) Let's go into the school auditorium .
neutral,Now that take this seat . Do you see those piles of red diplomas on the desks on the stage ?
neutral,Sorry . I didn't mean to be late . Can I come in ?
neutral,"Yes , twice last week ."
neutral,I don't think so . But it could've been .
neutral,"Mike , I can't catch up with our Chinese teacher very well ."
neutral,Sure . You can review the lessons you have learned at school and learn something new there .
neutral,Hi . You look excited . What's happening ?
neutral,Do you think you have a chance ?
neutral,Don't be too sure . You're still going to need some help .
neutral,"Yeah , maybe ."
neutral,"Hi , Li Ming . You look upset . What's the matter ?"
neutral,I am new to this school and not familiar with this library . Can you help me ?
neutral,"Hi , Tony . You look unhappy . What's wrong ?"
neutral,But what you should do is study hard .
neutral,So long as you learn from your mistakes .
neutral,When will school start ?
neutral,It'll start on lst September .
neutral,I usually ride my bike . Which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
neutral,"If you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too !"
neutral,Oh yes I am . I have always wanted to go to the States . I love meeting new people and making new friends .
neutral,"Well , I am sure you will ."
neutral,"Pretty good . Say , where are you living this semester ?"
neutral,OK .
neutral,Mr . : Right here is the cafeteria .
neutral,But it doesn't look like a real bus stop .
neutral,That's because regular buses don't stop here .
neutral,"Mr . : I'm Mr . Rogers , your homeroom teacher ."
neutral,But I have to go to my homeroom .
neutral,No .
neutral,I'm Mary . I can't find my American literature class .
neutral,I'm sorry that I'm late . I couldn't find the room .
neutral,"Mr . : That's alright . It's the first day of school , after all ."
neutral,May I have a book ?
neutral,"Mr . : Here . Write your name inside the front cover . Remember that you must return the textbook to me at the end of the semester , so keep it in good condition ."
neutral,A driver ’ s license or something showing that you live in this city .
neutral,The phone bill ’ s in my name .
neutral,"That ’ ll do.Bring the most recent one in with your completed application , and we ’ ll issue you a temporary library card right away ."
neutral,Is anybody in ?
neutral,I have a headache .
neutral,"You should've called in sick ! Next time , have either of your parents call the school office ."
neutral,( quietly ) I don't understand what the teacher is saying .
neutral,What courses did you take in college ?
neutral,What courses did you minor in ?
neutral,Did you join the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) ?
neutral,You can renew the books over the computer .
neutral,What was it for ?
neutral,I was a naughty boy and I played hooky . So the school gave me a punishment to clear the classroom for a week .
neutral,Yes . I suppose so .
neutral,Part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ?
neutral,I usually have the wrong notion that he's very serious .
neutral,He'll never do well in mathematics .
neutral,How do you feel about that ?
neutral,"Hello , Hong Lei . My name's Ricky ."
neutral,"No , I've been here for six months ."
neutral,No . But she taught me last term . How long have you been here ?
neutral,"In your first letter , that is , when you apply for admission , you should also tell them you need their financial aid ."
neutral,Then ...
neutral,"Hello , what can I do for you ?"
neutral,I am looking for some information about home stay .
neutral,"Well , that depends . If you stay for a long time . They will offer a discount ."
neutral,Does that mean studying all the time ?
neutral,"Me too . To keep up with the changing world , one must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things ."
neutral,"Yes , so I want to learn French to develop my career ."
neutral,You are always happy and able to achieve high scores at school .
neutral,Maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure .
neutral,"Sure . But it's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow ."
neutral,I hope you'll do better in the final .
neutral,Do you think he can do well ?
neutral,Yes .
neutral,Who are we going to play with today ?
neutral,We will have our midterm exams next month . I plan to look for some important books and study at the library . Do you want to join me ?
neutral,That sounds like a good idea . We can chill out a little in such a hot summer . Are you good at swimming ?
neutral,See you then .
neutral,"Yeah , I've got everything from rock n ' roll to the latest new - wave stuff ."
neutral,The summer vacation is coming . Have you any plans ?
neutral,"Hello , this is the International Student Office . My name is Leah . How may I help you ?"
neutral,"I'd like to speak to the Ms . Collins , please ."
neutral,"Ok . Can I ask who is calling , please ?"
neutral,"... Sorry , her line is busy at the moment . Can I take a message ?"
neutral,I got it . When should I have her call you back ?
neutral,Sure . Look here . Canada is north of the United States .
neutral,Boston is in the northeast part of the country .
neutral,Good morning .
neutral,The reason I'm calling is because Ms . Collins will not be able to call you back until next week .
neutral,Is there someone else I can talk to ?
neutral,I'd prefer to speak with Ms . Fonda .
neutral,Yes . Here you are .
neutral,"Well , I'm sure you will ."
neutral,You are welcome . Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions .
neutral,I don't really know for sure yet . I'll tell you after the test on Friday .
neutral,I didn't mean to . Things just kept taking up all of my time .
neutral,Maybe you got your plate too full this semester ? You can change that next semester .
neutral,I think I'd better . I have twenty four credits this time around . That might be a bit much .
neutral,Yes . Did you know that the senior class president works for the class for life ? The job doesn't stop when we graduate .
neutral,What do you think of the local accent here ? Has it been causing you any problems ?
neutral,I think it's just a matter of getting used to it .
neutral,"Do not take things so seriously , my pal ! Every one of us will face the trouble and job-hunting is inevitable . Take it easy ! Believe in yourself and some day you will be successful ."
neutral,Let's make it the first item of business in our next meeting .
neutral,I really like my debate class .
neutral,I've entertained the idea . But I'm I leaning more toward politics .
neutral,Yes . I am interested in applying for graduate school in America .
neutral,"Oh , no . It's already February 5th ."
neutral,"Good morning , Miss ."
neutral,I hope we can make great progress in this new semester .
neutral,Just calm down . I'm sure you'll do well .
neutral,How about the shelf ?
neutral,"Johnny , you did badly on the test . I think you haven't been studying enough . Am I right ?"
neutral,The final examination will be held at the end of this month . Have you made good preparation ?
neutral,Yes .
neutral,"No . You'd look under ' W ' . The articles ' a ' and ' the ' don't count in our alphabetization , and cards are generally omitted for extremely common words and phrases such as ' history of ' , ' introduction to ' , ' story of ' and so forth ."
neutral,Could you give me an example ?
neutral,"Suppose you want to find a book by your professor , William Smith . You'd look under SMITH and then WILLIAM . Since that's very common name , you may have to go through several ' William Smith ' until you come to the one who wrote book on the subject you are interested in ."
neutral,Excuse me . Mr . Li . May I ask you some questions ?
neutral,"A Bachelor is awarded to a student who successfully completes over 120 units , including general and specific requirements , for his or her undergraduate major and elective courses ."
neutral,Normally it can be completed in four years .
neutral,He had moved and held a party on July 1st .
neutral,It's a pity that I was traveling around Europe at that time .
neutral,I'm sick . I think I've got the flu .
neutral,Let me take a look . Maybe I can figure it out .
neutral,My field is electronic engineering . Which country do you think I should go ?
neutral,I think I'm going to decline . I just prefer to do my own thing .
neutral,"My dad was , but not my mom ."
neutral,The first place you should go is the International Center .
neutral,Why ?
neutral,You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers .
neutral,What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ?
neutral,"What are you going to do for one year abroad , Tom ?"
neutral,You are going to take courses ?
neutral,Won't you get lonely ?
neutral,Could you tell me how to use the library ?
neutral,How long can I keep the books ?
neutral,"For one month . If you can ’ t return the books in time , you'll be fined . But if you renew them , you can keep them longer ."
neutral,I see . Now I want to check out two books on spoken English . Can you show me where I can find them ?
neutral,No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ?
neutral,Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here .
neutral,"Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around ."
neutral,Ok .
neutral,I register this Friday .
neutral,Is that class really that popular ?
neutral,Is he an easy grader ?
neutral,"Well , it's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have ."
neutral,Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class .
neutral,What happened to you ?
neutral,You're right . I'm not going to play games during school anymore .
neutral,I took summer school . I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up .
neutral,She dropped out of school completely .
neutral,Of course . Registering for classes is not something you want to miss .
neutral,Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ?
neutral,Can I help you ?
neutral,"Hi Kevin , how was your year at college ?"
neutral,Maybe you're right . I have been too lazy lately .
neutral,"Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion ."
neutral,"But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?"
neutral,"That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion ."
neutral,"That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries ."
neutral,"So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?"
neutral,It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .
neutral,Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .
neutral,They were not too bad . I really liked my poli-sci class .
neutral,Would you consider it your favorite class ?
neutral,What class was your favorite then ?
neutral,I took a business communication class last year and it was terrific .
neutral,Yeah . Last semester .
neutral,Are you enjoying the class so far ?
neutral,Hi Jackie . You don't look too well . What's going on ?
neutral,It's nothing . I'm just a little stressed out .
neutral,Why ? What's stressing you out ?
neutral,The best thing to do is study as much as you can . I'm sure you'll do alright .
neutral,"That sounds like a hot job , right ? But in my opinion , you ought not to choose one career from that so-called list , and you need to take your interests , values , and skills into account ."
neutral,"Yes , it is . I'm Jennifer . Nice to meet you ."
neutral,Excuse me . May I ask you some questions ?
neutral,"Oh , I know . When is it ?"
neutral,OK . Here you are .
neutral,"Peter , which club do you want to join ?"
neutral,We have a class outing today .
neutral,Whip me if I get below 80 marks out of 100 !
neutral,Yes . Can you help me remember how to spell ' beautiful ' ?
neutral,"Welcome to our school . If you need any help , please come to me ."
neutral,"Peter , have you finished your English composition ?"
neutral,No . But I ’ m working on it .
neutral,I know . I know !
neutral,All right . But how ?
neutral,I've already got your certificate for sick leave . How do you feel today ?
neutral,I've already got it . Thanks .
neutral,I will .
neutral,Don't lose heart . Everything will be fine .
neutral,What's this then ?
neutral,"It's my geography , sir.The Map of Africa you set us ."
neutral,What about water pollution instead of pollution ?
neutral,I see . Has she read any detective stories ?
neutral,"I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look ."
neutral,"Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ?"
neutral,Harry Potter .
neutral,Have you ever read this book before ?
neutral,Me too . Pride and Prejudice is my favorite .
neutral,"Yeah , my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me . Or I chat with my friends through text messages ."
neutral,Thanks .
neutral,Here you are . You must return them within a month .
neutral,You can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them .
neutral,"Good morning , Miss ."
neutral,For two weeks . After that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer .
neutral,Yes . May I help you ?
neutral,Sure . 3 thirty this afternoon .
neutral,"Maybe another time . People say that boys ' dormitories are in a mess , is it true ?"
neutral,"In fact , our dormitory is much worse than they can be described ."
neutral,It's hard for me to imagine . How can you stand that ?
neutral,Why are you so pessimistic ?
neutral,"That is true . I ’ ll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It ’ s usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars ."
neutral,What's to come next ?
neutral,"Well . When you review your lessons , mark the places which you don't understand , then I will give you some coaching ."
neutral,Where are you going ?
neutral,The job market is so competitive nowadays . I want to develop some useful skills .
neutral,I ’ m trying to decide what school to apply for .
neutral,Which is better ?
neutral,"I have to take my exams for getting into the university , so I need to prepare ."
neutral,"It has to ! I ’ Ve been studying every day , eight hours a day ! I don ’ t know , but the school has a great success record ."
neutral,"I'm sorry , but that class is already full.And also , students are supposed to register through the touch-tone registration system ."
neutral,"Well , I could put you on a waiting list.But that doesn't guarantee you will get into the class . What is your name ?"
neutral,My name is Karen Huang . That's spelled H - U - A - N - G .
neutral,Have you decided what you are going to take next semester ?
neutral,I brought my transcript from my first year.Here . And here is the list of courses I plan to take in the fall .
neutral,"Yes , I agree ."
neutral,Is that right ?
neutral,"Yes , that's right ."
neutral,"Well , I hope you let me hang out with you then . Maybe I can learn from you ."
neutral,"Oh , certainly . Certainly . I'm always willing to help beginners.Just call me Big Brother Dave ."
neutral,"Well , I came to talk to you because I want to apply for a scholarship ."
neutral,"Thanks . I really appreciate it.In fact , I do need a letter of recommendation for this scholarship ."
neutral,What kind of scholarship is it ?
neutral,"I'm a junior now , and my GPA is 3.92 ."
neutral,"Yes , but I need to write it by next week ."
neutral,"First , I need a letter of recommendation ."
neutral,I'd be happy to write one for you .
neutral,Ok . And I ’ d like to check these books out .
neutral,"Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad ."
neutral,"Yes , I am . I am from Taiwan . I came here to study political science ."
neutral,Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters ?
neutral,"You just said your English needs work , yes ?"
neutral,"Yes , that's true . Especially my writing . I think my papers aren't good enough . I make too many grammatical mistakes ."
neutral,Let's see ... My schedule right now is quite busy.But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange .
neutral,I think it sounds like a good system . But when is it convenient to meet ?
neutral,"Well , today is Monday.Actually , for me Monday at this time would be the best . I am free from now until 11"
neutral,And I will bring my textbook and a tape recorder . I would like to record some things so I can practice on my own .
neutral,Oh ... I am really worried about the exam . I have no idea what will be on it .
neutral,"There are different things you can do.For one , the university offers a special free course on note-taking.You should go to the course . Also , I am pretty good at taking notes . I can help you on this exam . I will photocopy all my notes , and you can compare them to your notes.Then maybe you will see what kinds of things to write down ."
neutral,Yes . Or you can bring it yourself .
neutral,I will ask my friends for you.Maybe someone knows a company that needs part-time people.That ' s another thing you should do . Ask all your friends to ask around for you.You might find something .
neutral,"The Card doesn't actually give you discounts on beer.But it will give you discounts on certain club cover charges.So if you want to see your favorite band at Amy's or Cosmo's Club , you get a discount on the entrance fee ."
neutral,Usually it's two dollars off the cover price .
neutral,I ’ m speaking French . Don ’ t you know anything ?
neutral,"Ms . Lee , could you tell me what number 7 is again ? I didn't catch you ."
neutral,I hope the teacher decides to curve our test grades .
neutral,She did last time .
neutral,Pretty busy . I have to pick up a lot of credits this year .
neutral,When is it due ?
neutral,"I'd like to , but I'm not sure if I'll have enough money ."
neutral,"Yes , sir ."
neutral,"Ok , I will get you another one ."
neutral,"I am , sir ."
neutral,"It's me , sir . But I am sorry I have forgotten to prepare for it ."
neutral,"Sure , very difficult ."
neutral,Remind me never to sign up for that course .
neutral,What's up ?
neutral,That will be fine . When can I see him ?
neutral,"By bus , of course ."
neutral,"Ok , see you then ."
neutral,"Well , do you all major in the same subject ?"
neutral,Who is it ?
neutral,I'm sorry about this .
neutral,"Thanks . I don't suppose you have some paper , too ."
neutral,Of course . There you are .
neutral,Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ?
neutral,"Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere ."
neutral,One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers .
neutral,I hear you have to wear uniforms at private school .
neutral,Which university should I apply to ?
neutral,Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year .
neutral,Are you sure you can do well this year ?
neutral,Yes . I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa .
neutral,Do you know where the visa office is ?
neutral,Sure . What do you want to find ?
neutral,Hope so .
neutral,I hear we ’ ll have a new English teacher this semester .
neutral,"Yeah , yeah , I know , it's totally cliche , but really , I think it's been a good decision . I've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys . What about you ? What have you been up to ?"
neutral,Not much . I'm still living at home and commuting to school . I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about . It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped . The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count .
neutral,That sounds smart ... but kind of boring .
neutral,Shih ! ! Please keep your voice down . There are people reading and studying here .
neutral,No . How do I get one ?
neutral,Here you go .
neutral,"Wow , you are going to be busy this semester ! Okay , here you go . You are registered now , you ’ ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start ."
neutral,How should we commemorate the centenary of the founding of the university ? We have been given quite a large budget to pay for some events .
neutral,"If we do , too many people might attend . Perhaps we should invited all of them , but make a small charge to attend ."
neutral,"Hey Eve , how are you ?"
neutral,I ’ m ok . I ’ m so busy !
neutral,Yes . Are you ?
neutral,Do you want to study together ?
neutral,"Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ?"
neutral,"Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English ."
neutral,Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
neutral,One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .
neutral,"Lucy , you ’ re back . How was your first day of school ?"
neutral,"Well , I had English from 9 o'clock to 11 o'clock , art from 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock , and math from 2 o'clock to 4 o'clock ."
neutral,"If you like the class this much already , I ’ m sure you will ."
neutral,I hope so .
neutral,"That would have to be Miss Baymler , my fourth grade teacher ."
neutral,Yes . She treated us all fairly . She don ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets .
neutral,Do you know what she is doing now ?
neutral,Have you ever read one of the books ?
neutral,"You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use ."
neutral,What do you think of the teacher ?
neutral,"Well , yes . I don't mind admitting that I am . I enjoyed school , but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams ."
neutral,Where are you going now ?
neutral,Why did the teacher criticise Myra in front of the whole class ?
neutral,And how long does the course last ?
neutral,When does it start ?
neutral,From 7 to 9 o'clock .
neutral,I major in Japanese .
neutral,Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up .
neutral,Of course it depends on what you are going to do when you leave college . Have you beside what you are going to do when you graduated ?
neutral,Yes . I started this part-time job just three days ago . And my internship will last 1 week . I'm still a student now .
neutral,OK then . I don't want to put you in trouble .
neutral,"Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses ."
neutral,Study English .
neutral,"Let's program your courses , since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction . You transcript indicate that your english background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it ."
neutral,"Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will ."
neutral,"It should be , but there are too many options . My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices , but after that ..."
neutral,"I know . You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country , a big school or a small school , a public or private school ..."
neutral,"Yup , you understand . And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college . They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline . And the tuition is usually pretty low ."
neutral,"Oh , I ’ m not . I ’ Ve never had a music class before ."
neutral,You ’ re having me on again .
neutral,it's easy ! Just go and get a card .
neutral,You can always take it again .
neutral,Can I help you ?
neutral,Will there be anything else ?
neutral,There are several possible sources you might use for that topic . I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television .
neutral,It's too high . I can't reach it.Could you help me ?
neutral,A month . Don't forget to return them by the due date .
neutral,What if I can't finish them by then ?
neutral,Sure .
neutral,It was always very busy there .
neutral,"Yes , but it's checked out ."
neutral,"Yes , please ."
neutral,Would you recommend some materials on the World War Two ?
neutral,Have you found a particular item from the card catalogue ?
neutral,"By the way , can I renew the borrowing ?"
neutral,For which one ?
neutral,"OK , thanks ."
neutral,Here you are . Thanks .
neutral,I see . How do you like the game ?
neutral,Who do you think do better ?
neutral,It might be the English teacher . What about you ?
neutral,"Me , too . She speaks very clearly and doesn't use very complicated words so that it is easy for us to understand her ."
neutral,I've been so stressed these days .
neutral,"That's only a joke . To be honest , I have to improve my English , because my English is not good enough . I still get confused about some simple grammars . Since you are quite good at it , do you have any suggestions ?"
neutral,"Hello , 8520388 2 ."
neutral,OK .
neutral,Explain the economic law ? An essay question again ?
neutral,"I don't think so , Maria , but I think you can look for information on the Internet ."
neutral,There isn't such a code ?
neutral,"Yes , it's a general name for several laws related to economics , like Commercial Law , and Law of Central Bank ."
neutral,"Are these your text books ? Biochemistry , General Ecology , Botany , Cell Genetics , Molecular Genetics ..."
neutral,Yes . I gotta review all of them for the final exam . It is just around the corner .
neutral,"Of course , it's useful . And it's very crucial to have the copies of teacher's notes , because most questions in the exam are based on them ."
neutral,I know . I have to prepare the supper for the whole family before I leave .
neutral,It's close coming up at the end of this month . That will be no more than 15 days from now on .
neutral,"Why don't you take the CPA exam ? You are already a good accountant , having so many years of experience ."
neutral,So you just talk all the time ?
neutral,"Of course not . The foreign teachers also teach us English songs , and play games with us ."
neutral,What are you major in ?
neutral,What do you think of the literature course .
neutral,"Yes , we do ."
neutral,And how long does the course last ?
neutral,"Yes , that's all right . I want to enroll in the course ."
neutral,"Thank you , please fill out this form for us ."
neutral,Do you want me to fill it out now ?
neutral,"That's normal . You have been sitting for three hours , with your attention highly concentrated ."
neutral,How could he make such a silly mistake ?
neutral,"Come in , come in , what can I do for you ?"
neutral,"Yes , I am applying on it ."
neutral,"I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ..."
neutral,"Yes , I'm studying in the Foreign Languages Department ."
neutral,I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries . I like the culture .
neutral,Right.It ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well .
neutral,What do you like to do with your free time ?
neutral,"Yes , I think so , If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course ."
neutral,Not always.Sometimes we don't understand her.Then she has to repeat what she said .
neutral,Sometimes it's difficult.Some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
neutral,You can't help learning when you're using it all day.You ' ll see . A few weeks ' study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
neutral,"I hope so.You see , at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . I'm awfully worried , I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect ."
neutral,"You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use ."
neutral,Is she your teacher ?
neutral,Yes . She teaches our class three times a week .
neutral,And I hear he gives very good lectures .
neutral,"Miss Fallen , can you tell me why you want to get a visa to the States ?"
neutral,And do you have the Letter of Acceptance from the University with you ?
neutral,"Could I see that , please ?"
neutral,Our maths teacher is rather humorous .
neutral,"On the contrary , I think he's very serious ."
neutral,"Yeah , how about your maths teacher ?"
neutral,She's another antique .
neutral,You're got a point there . But do you think he's a little absent-minded ?
neutral,I guess so .
neutral,I don't think the teacher had a right to say that . The teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class .
neutral,"You've got to be joking ! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants , and if she saw Myra cheating , she certainly had the right to say so ."
neutral,"I agree she had the right to say something , but I feel she should have done it privately ."
neutral,"You're right . If I were the teacher , I wouldn't have done that ."
neutral,Why did the teacher criticise Myra in front of the whole class ?
neutral,What do your classmates think of it ?
neutral,How long will you study there .
neutral,Chicago University . My major is Economics .
neutral,"Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ?"
neutral,"Yes , I am applying on it ."
neutral,Of course it depends on what you are going to do when you leave college . Have you decide what you are going to do when you graduated ?
neutral,Where's Mrs . Johnson ?
neutral,"Just call her Lisa , Mary . She's cooking dinner ."
neutral,Of course ! Make yourself at home .
neutral,"Please , just call me Tom ."
neutral,I don't mind helping .
neutral,I'm going to sweep the floor first .
neutral,I like science most .
neutral,I thought you would like PE .
neutral,"Through this course , I can learn more about the world around us clearly ."
neutral,Your parents would be happy if they knew that . Because you are always a naughty boy .
neutral,"Oh , you can climb the stairs as a workout ."
neutral,"Yes , that's a good idea ."
neutral,Is that different from our school's English course ?
neutral,"That is the library . And it has more than 1,000 , 000 books ."
neutral,What's the building to the south of the library ?
neutral,Is there a swimming pool in your school ?
neutral,"OK , do you know the title of the book ?"
neutral,Do you offer a course in business management ?
neutral,Do you want me to fill it out now ?
neutral,"Yes , please . We need a record of you education and your work experiences ."
neutral,At five .
neutral,How long do you usually stay at university ?
neutral,"You can check out two books at a time . But you can't check out newspapers , magazines and periodicals ; they have to be read within library ."
neutral,Sure . 3:30 this afternoon .
neutral,Can I help you ?
neutral,You can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them .
neutral,"English , of course ."
neutral,"Well , what are you going to do now ? Have you made any plans ?"
neutral,That's too much for us really .
neutral,Our maths teacher is rather humorous .
neutral,What do you think of your teacher ?
neutral,"Nothing special . I had a get-together with some schoolmates at the high school , visited the Internet and read a couple of books which I had been longing for . How about yours ?"
neutral,What about ?
neutral,My exam .
neutral,I ’ d like to go into management . I ’ Ve applied for several jobs already and I ’ m hopeful that I ’ ll get some job offers . How about you ?
neutral,"as long as you plan carefully , most thing are possible . It ’ s always good to have a backup plan in case things go wrong ."
neutral,I am looking for a newspaper article .
neutral,There are the pyramids . It ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though .
neutral,Look at that cylindrical office building . I ’ Ve never been seen one that shape before .
neutral,This is the world ’ s largest sports stadium . It ’ s a massive oval .
neutral,What sports do they play there ?
neutral,"According to the book , it is . I ’ Ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . Look at the building . From the air , it looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides . What"
neutral,I just bought a new atlas . I ’ m looking this map of the world . Look at Russia ! That ’ s a vast country .
neutral,The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
neutral,It seems you have late fees .
neutral,"Yes , I ’ m sure ."
neutral,I don ’ t have that much today .
neutral,I ’ ll pay it as soon as possible .
neutral,I don ’ t have a library card .
neutral,Please fill out this application .
neutral,What can I do for you ?
neutral,You can apply for one here .
neutral,Can you tell me where I can park ?
neutral,I drive an automobile .
neutral,Good morning . Is this where I can get a library card issued to me ?
neutral,"I am pretty sure how to use it , but can you remind me ?"
neutral,Could you e-mail me this week as a reminder ?
neutral,Make good use of that day off ; you'll only have one this semester !
neutral,Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me .
neutral,Sign me up for Monday and Wednesday .
neutral,Can you tell me what the date and time of our field trip is ?
neutral,We are leaving on our science field trip at 8 a . m . next Monday . Do you have something to write that down on ?
neutral,That will be on the second of December . Be there half an hour early to get your bags on the bus . Do you understand ?
neutral,Can you tell me what days the classes are on ?
neutral,Are there any Psychology classes available ?
neutral,Can you tell me about the other class ?
neutral,I can't seem to find my class .
neutral,It's room number 261 .
neutral,"No problem , come on ."
neutral,My German teacher thought it would be a good idea to have German pen friends to write to in German .
neutral,The only thing is that my pen friend will be writing in English .
neutral,Maybe Olga can introduce you to some of her friends who can write to you in German and you can do the same for her with your friends to write her in English .
neutral,What do you think now ?
neutral,But I still say Americans spend a lot more money on useless things than we Chinese do .
neutral,How long will it take to learn English ? Will I be able to take other courses next semester or will English take up all of my time ?
neutral,No . You just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation . Then you go on practicing and learning outside . A lot of learning depends on your personal motivation .
neutral,You said it .
neutral,I never know when to shake hands and when not to . Can you tell me something about it ?
neutral,Do you come from a country where they shake hands ?
neutral,"Oh yes . Men , women , and children shake hands all the time ."
neutral,"Well , a good rule to follow is , for men you hold out your hand , for women and children , you wait and see what they do ."
neutral,"In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page ."
neutral,A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ?
neutral,"I ’ Ve always wondered , what ’ s the difference between English for Chinese students and English for native students ?"
neutral,"It ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ?"
neutral,"It takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ’ t it ?"
neutral,I think I will continue my studies . Now it's not easy for a graduate with bachelor's degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master's or doctor's degree . We are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market .
neutral,So you will continue to study for a master's degree ?
neutral,How can you finance your education abroad ? It is very expensive to study abroad .
neutral,"Are you ok , Chuck ? You look pale ."
neutral,"You did ? Do tell me . I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it , but I've made little progress !"
neutral,You can say that . I can actually sing some of them now .
neutral,I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer .
neutral,Great . Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary ?
neutral,How's your time spent in the United States ?
neutral,Absolutely . Now I understand why he responded that way .
neutral,That's so true . It's great that we see eye to eye on this .
neutral,Yeah .
neutral,"Well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies ."
neutral,"Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia ."
neutral,"Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan ."
neutral,To me English is a difficult language .
neutral,What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense .
neutral,"Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes ."
neutral,"I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it ."
neutral,"He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good ."
neutral,Where did you get that idea ?
neutral,"That ’ s the impression I get from the movies , and from looking around . Men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other ."
neutral,"After being raised together , men and women can be business-like in each other ’ s company . It really doesn ’ t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love . Does that answer your question ?"
neutral,Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction . It's hard work .
neutral,I don't mind the work . I think it's worthwhile .
neutral,You hit the nail right on the head .
neutral,"Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ?"
neutral,I'm majoring in English .
neutral,Is it difficult to learn ?
neutral,You're right .
neutral,You can't help learning when you're using it all day . You'll see . A few weeks ' study in the school will have a similar effect on you .
neutral,"You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use ."
neutral,There are hundreds and hundreds . English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .
neutral,Look . Here are the core classes . Everyone has to take them .
neutral,"Excuse me , I need your assistance ."
neutral,I know where the C building is .
neutral,"Yes , I guess basic speaking in the English is easier ."
neutral,"Sadly , I hardly ever speak to English people . I usually practice with my Chinese friends ."
neutral,Do you mind helping me ?
neutral,I'm not sure how to find my next class .
neutral,Do you know what the room number is ?
neutral,My next class is around there .
neutral,"Well , when you have that , you can take it over to the bookstore . Can you find it ?"
neutral,"Yes , I know a great place . What types of food do you like ?"
neutral,When are we leaving for our field trip ?
neutral,I am going to post all of that information on the geology club web page . Check it out when you get a chance . See you Monday !
neutral,"Maybe just a quick sandwich , salad , or something ."
neutral,"Hi , could you help me find a place where I could buy some lunch ?"
neutral,Sure ! What kind of food would you like ?
neutral,Good ! Where is it ?
neutral,I hope it works !
neutral,First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot . The dollars have to be smooth .
neutral,"OK , next ?"
neutral,Hope that works for you !
neutral,Off campus or on campus ?
neutral,It's on the west side of the campus .
neutral,Do you know if the parking structure is full or not ?
neutral,Perfect ! Do you know the hours and rules for the library ?
neutral,I want to know how to buy something from this machine .
neutral,Just remember that you might have to feed the money in a couple of times to get it to work .
neutral,You can park in the student parking structure .
neutral,You'll find the parking structure on the west side of the campus .
neutral,"OK , here it is ."
neutral,You seem to have filled the form out all right . Are you familiar with our rules and fines ?
neutral,"Yes , I know what to do ."
neutral,There's a parking structure for students .
neutral,Is it full ?
neutral,Do you need anything else ?
neutral,What can I do for you ?
neutral,What ’ s the problem ?
neutral,Have you checked the computer ?
neutral,Can I do anything else for you ?
neutral,I want to check this magazine out .
neutral,Do you have your library card ?
neutral,Will that be all for today ?
neutral,Here you go .
neutral,Were you here last week ?
neutral,Yes . Are you going to be taking a class from him ?
neutral,He is very interesting and challenging . Is that what you are looking for ?
neutral,"Yes , I had a teacher like that before ."
neutral,I am glad that that works out ; can you find my office ?
neutral,"Yes , I can ."
neutral,Just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor .
neutral,"If you need to cancel your appointment , please give me a call !"
neutral,But couldn't you have done it when you felt better ?
neutral,You have already missed one other assignment ; when can I expect the make-ups ?
neutral,Let me tell you what happened to my homework .
neutral,I'll try .
neutral,"Maybe , but I'm not sure ."
neutral,Yes . Have you ever been in one of his classes ?
neutral,"I'm not sure because I really need to learn something , but I also worry about grades ."
neutral,"Grades are important , but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important , too ?"
neutral,"Professor , could I make an appointment with you ?"
neutral,Two o'clock would be the best time .
neutral,"Remember , it is in the E building on the third floor ."
neutral,I'll see you then .
neutral,You have to bring me an add sheet to sign . Do you have one ?
neutral,"When , exactly do you need to leave ?"
neutral,I am unsure how to add a class and need help .
neutral,What date will our field trip be on ?
neutral,"Excuse me , Professor , I have a problem and need to leave class early ."
neutral,I am not feeling well .
neutral,"Yes , it's all taken care of ."
neutral,Do you have an add sheet for me to sign ?
neutral,"No , I have not seen the signs ."
neutral,Are you going to go right away ?
neutral,I park days and evenings .
neutral,What signs ?
neutral,What curb colors ?
neutral,Will you be driving a motorcycle or a car ?
neutral,It seems that I've been given two classes scheduled at the same time .
neutral,Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day .
neutral,"No , thank you ."
neutral,Will you be riding a motorcycle or do you drive a car ?
neutral,Do you need a second permit for a car ?
neutral,What can I do for you today ?
neutral,I have an issue with my schedule .
neutral,"Oh , I see ."
neutral,"Great , do you need directions to my office ?"
neutral,I was supposed to meet with you at half past one .
neutral,"Yes , I see . What did you need to see me about ?"
neutral,What's the problem ?
neutral,"Well , I can see that's a problem ."
neutral,"Yes , let's total it ."
neutral,"Well , if I total that like this and divide by this number , I get this total . Do you agree ?"
neutral,"Yeah , I see the same thing ; now we can do the math and check that , right ?"
neutral,"OK , let's do the calculation ."
neutral,"Anytime you have a question , please feel free to ask !"
neutral,I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades .
neutral,What counts the most ?
neutral,What if we miss something ?
neutral,What if we are out sick ?
neutral,I am worried that I messed up on a test .
neutral,I don ’ t have one .
neutral,That ’ s fine .
neutral,All right . All done .
neutral,"The final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework , attendance , and quizzes total 60 percent ."
neutral,What if we can't get to school ?
neutral,I want to know if I am doing OK .
neutral,Let's pull out your scores so far . Do you think you are doing OK ?
neutral,I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well .
neutral,"I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas , but not so well in others ."
neutral,Am I failing ?
neutral,Thanks for stopping by !
neutral,Okay . Let me do that right now .
neutral,Could you please sign the back of the card ?
neutral,All right .
neutral,What can I do for you ?
neutral,You ’ re going to have to pay late fees .
neutral,That means 25 cents for each late book .
neutral,May I help you with something ?
neutral,Yeah . I totally forgot they were due .
neutral,How much are the late fees ?
neutral,That shouldn ’ t be a problem .
neutral,What happened to this book ?
neutral,"I dropped it , and the cover tore off ."
neutral,I know it ’ s not .
neutral,Here ’ s the money for the book .
neutral,Thank you for your payment .
neutral,I accidentally ripped the cover .
neutral,You will need to pay for the damage .
neutral,May I help you ?
neutral,I will call you when I find it .
neutral,What can I do for you ?
neutral,I already did .
neutral,Will you ever get another copy ?
neutral,We will definitely be getting another .
neutral,That won ’ t be a problem .
neutral,How may I help you ?
neutral,Have you checked the database ?
neutral,Was it on the shelf ?
neutral,Maybe someone took it .
neutral,Will you be getting another copy anytime soon ?
neutral,Here they are .
neutral,I have it right here .
neutral,I want to get a passport .
neutral,What ’ s next ?
neutral,Is there something wrong ?
neutral,"It said that the book is on the shelf , but it isn ’ t ."
neutral,I also want to check out this video .
neutral,Do you have your library card ?
neutral,"If you damage the video , you will be fined ."
neutral,I won ’ t damage it .
neutral,May I do anything else for you ?
neutral,You are only allowed to check out books or videos .
neutral,"I ’ m sorry , but that ’ s our policy ."
neutral,What may I do for you ?
neutral,When will I be able to do that ?
neutral,That ’ s fine .
neutral,Please fill out this application .
neutral,Then what do I do ?
neutral,How long will it take for my passport to be ready ?
neutral,I would like to check out these books .
neutral,Yes . Here you go .
neutral,"Until you pay it , you can ’ t check out books ."
neutral,I will pay it . Don ’ t worry .
neutral,How many copies am I allowed to make ?
neutral,There is no limit to how many copies you can make .
neutral,"Oh , okay . Thanks ."
neutral,May I help you ?
neutral,Do I need to pay to use it ?
neutral,There are instructions posted on the copier .
neutral,What do you need ?
neutral,I need to use the Internet .
neutral,Would you please write your name on this list ?
neutral,Use the number on the back of your library card .
neutral,Do you have your library card with you ?
neutral,"Yes , I have it ."
neutral,All you do is type in the number on the back of your card .
neutral,What can I help you with today ?
neutral,Do you need anything else ?
neutral,"No , that ’ s all . Thanks ."
neutral,Do you need anything ?
neutral,How are you ?
neutral,Am I limited to a certain number of copies ?
neutral,The instructions for the copier are posted on it .
neutral,It closes at six .
neutral,which country do you want to go to ?
neutral,"if you're worried about money , the cost of living is lowest in America . However , if you go to Oxford University , you'll probably be able to get any job you want in the future ."
neutral,I just can't decide where to go . It's not an easy decision to make .
neutral,"no , in fact , I was terrible at taking exams ."
neutral,when do you plan on studying for those exams ?
neutral,do you think that's a good idea ?
neutral,that sounds like a good idea . What are you going to do if you have any questions while you're studying ?
neutral,do you think you studied enough for the exam ?
neutral,what did you do last night ?
neutral,alright . Get out your books and I'll help you prepare .
neutral,"so , how's your course going ? Do you like it ?"
neutral,"i like my professors and the classes , but it's a lot of work ."
neutral,"well , I grew up in Africa , so I learned quite a few different languages ."
neutral,how do you think you did ?
neutral,That's because you did well .
neutral,what kind of course are you looking for ?
neutral,did you go to university ?
neutral,"yes , I graduated with a BA in English from Qingdao University ."
neutral,I think you should do that soon . It will help you make a decision about the school you go to .
neutral,"can I see your passport , please ?"
neutral,is this line for non-residents ?
neutral,"I think it's soon , maybe in a few months . It was renewed in Beijing , so the new expiry date is on the last page ."
neutral,"I see . Yes , you'll need to renew your passport in a few months . Make sure you don't let it expire while you are in the UK ."
neutral,how long will you be staying in the UK ?
neutral,how do you plan on paying for your living costs and tuition fees while you are here ?
neutral,Doesn't look like it to me .
neutral,Maybe I could help .
neutral,"oh , my lord . I haven't really started them ."
neutral,I know but I was busy with my part-time job the last few days .
neutral,"Jenny , you look terrible . What's eating you ?"
neutral,do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them ?
neutral,here's Lisa . May I take a picture with her ?
neutral,"why are you so upset today , Maria ? Cheer up !"
neutral,"oh , Iris , it ’ s about the job with the PR company ."
neutral,"I turned down quite a few offers before for her sake . But I ’ m a senior now , I don ’ t want to miss the chance this time ."
neutral,"I ’ ll try , but what if she insists ?"
neutral,"just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding . And more importantly , you can manage both your study and the job ."
neutral,sure . Every cloud has its silver lining . Just try .
neutral,what did you do after graduation ?
neutral,"I was planning to attend gradate school , but then I was offered a good job doing marketing , so I changed my mind ."
neutral,"I think you lack in the power of decision . Once you make your decision , don't be overtaken by misgivings and fear . Just go full steam ahead !"
neutral,wait ! You can't do so many things at the same time . What exactly do you want ?
neutral,"no , you can't waste your time wandering around . If you want a job that requires a higher degree or diploma , you should focus on your graduate school entrance exam ; if you want a job that needs working"
neutral,"absolutely , many Chinese enterprises are going global , and they are in great need of excellent returnees to help them with their overseas business ."
neutral,Where is the Computer Center ?
neutral,The Computer Center is on the first floor of the library .
neutral,Where is the library ?
neutral,"oh , it ’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ?"
neutral,"sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ’ s easy to figure out ."
neutral,"More or less . How well do you understand Mr . Wang , your Chinese teacher ?"
neutral,Of course .
neutral,I'm going to work in a multi-national enterprise after graduation .
neutral,it can save you lots of time and effort to simply copy a successful business model .
neutral,"yeah , the success stories of that company might be useful for me . And their customers may become the potential ones for my own company ."
neutral,"well , I'll come up with a detailed business plan to attract the investors ."
neutral,ok . I feel like sitting down and having a chat . How have you been recently ?
neutral,that ’ s a good idea . I usually just sit at home alone and get increasingly moody .
neutral,What are you reading ?
neutral,The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate .
neutral,Are the reports favorable ?
neutral,"Generally , the reporters take positive lines . They do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of , but there ’ s nothing worrying in the reports . In the classifieds , one of our competitors is a"
neutral,I see you have bought the latest copy of beauty and fashion . Are there any interesting articles in it ?
neutral,There ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The which ? section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . T
neutral,"Yes . There is . it has several sections , so it ’ s quite a read ! It usually takes me a few hours to read it on Sunday morning ."
neutral,"I buy a national newspaper sometimes , buy I nearly always buy a local evening newspaper . I find the local news more interesting than national or international news ."
neutral,"The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if English continues to be the dominant language ."
neutral,Why does he want to do that ?
neutral,"Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ?"
neutral,"Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn ’ t get a chance to memorize the second page , but I think I mastered the tricky section ."
neutral,Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ?
neutral,"That ’ s quite the array of nationalities . Everyone in my class is from Asia , except me . There are a few South Koreans , several Japanese , Malaysian , Thai , Singaporean , Filipino , Kazakhstan , and o"
neutral,"I guess so , but I think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . I think I might change classes ."
neutral,I highly doubt it . Your girlfriend is Chinese .
neutral,I ’ Ve been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross .
neutral,Sure.That ’ s not a problem.Do you have the list of courses you want to taketh semester ?
neutral,What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good .
neutral,"Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ?"
neutral,"Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ?"
neutral,"No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is ."
neutral,And then what happened ?
neutral,That ’ s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest .
neutral,What does that mean ?
neutral,"Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer ."
neutral,Me ! Me !
neutral,"As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times ."
neutral,I don ’ t have the slightest clue .
neutral,I ’ m not sure .
neutral,That ’ s not a bad idea .
neutral,You have a point .
neutral,You got a letter in the mail .
neutral,What is it ?
neutral,It ’ s my acceptance letter from UCLA .
neutral,What does it say ?
neutral,"NYU was my first choice , but UCLA is just fine ."
neutral,"I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program ."
neutral,I ’ ll just have to wait for UCLA .
neutral,I was just about to go to bed when the telephone rang last night .
neutral,Let me see it .
neutral,"I know you're right , but what can I do ?"
neutral,I see .
neutral,"No , I'm scared of cats ."
neutral,Forgive me darling . I'm very tired .
neutral,"No hard feelings . After all , he is a child ."
neutral,If you say so !
neutral,"Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ?"
neutral,But it's only a film .
neutral,I am tired of everything in my life .
neutral,It ’ s so unreliable . I ’ Ve been late for my meetings all this week .
neutral,"Yes , my customers have started to complain too !"
neutral,Because her children have been the age when they seem to quarrel all day long .
neutral,I don't think the lecture is very interesting .
neutral,He was very clever when he was a boy .
neutral,"Dear , forgive me . I won ’ t do that again ."
neutral,"Does he do that with his Dad ? I mean , does he complain things to his father ?"
neutral,He ’ s doing fine . A new broom sweeps clean .
neutral,What do you mean ?
neutral,It ’ s over .
neutral,The cause is another boy .
neutral,"Oh , that ’ s too bad ."
neutral,Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
neutral,Mr . Smith is really a thorough drag .
neutral,I'm not at all keen on this subject .
neutral,"No , seriously . I'm impressed ."
neutral,What's wrong with it ? It's filthy !
neutral,Oh ...
neutral,And my new car . To think that he simply drove off with everything in my car . That's what hurts me most .
neutral,What's up ? You look low .
neutral,Yes . I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .
neutral,What is it ?
neutral,There must be something wrong with her .
neutral,"Listen , Nancy . If I don't work hard , I will be laid off ."
neutral,"No , I encourage her to go her own way , but she's now having a change of heart ."
neutral,Can you take he away from me ?
neutral,That ’ s right .
neutral,But you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts .
neutral,I ’ m at the end of tether . I run out of ideas .
neutral,Jack borrowed a large sum of money from me and didn ’ t pay me back .
neutral,That would be terrible .
neutral,Our house is too small . We had better have a big one .
neutral,What is wrong with your face ?
neutral,I ’ m in pretty bad shape . I am having an allergy all the time .
neutral,I never trust those stupid doctors .
neutral,Hi .
neutral,You were playing it very late last night .
neutral,It kept me awake a couple of hours .
neutral,"I know I'm late . I'm sorry . I tried to call you to tell you , but your phone seems to be disconnected ."
neutral,"Yes , let's go ."
neutral,Can I borrow some money from you ?
neutral,No way !
neutral,That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you .
neutral,"Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call ."
neutral,"Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry ."
neutral,I wonder how much of the city is down .
neutral,It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer .
neutral,I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ?
neutral,I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection .
neutral,"Oh , that's all right ."
neutral,"I should still tell him . In the least , I can refer him to my company . It might help ."
neutral,"Go ahead . It's nothing serious . We are good friends , aren't we ?"
neutral,But Ben is not a bad man . I know him from A to Z .
neutral,It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging .
neutral,Don't hesitate . That's a very famous university which a lot of students are longing to attain .
neutral,"Yes , but you might have told me before ."
neutral,That's a cool jacket . Where did you get it ?
neutral,I'll make it up to you . Let me know how much it costs and I'll give you the money .
neutral,How did you meet her ?
neutral,I guess it was fate working to bring you together .
neutral,Can you stay and accompany me for a while ?
neutral,"No , not much . I got it on sale at the mall - 60 % off ."
neutral,It's a promise .
neutral,I think luck played a very small part in your victory . It is solely due to your hard work and efforts . That brings honor to you and joy to us .
neutral,I'm going to Britain .
neutral,So it is really worth your great effort . And hope you can keep the record you've made today .
neutral,"You don't have to play that record so loud , do you ?"
neutral,"That radio's pretty loud . Could you turn it down , please ?"
neutral,We're going to do something about it .
neutral,We can't put up with it any more .
neutral,I'm sorry . I thought you wouldn't mind .
neutral,"Mike , did you win the lottery or something ? Why the big smile ?"
neutral,You seem really ticked off . What's up ?
neutral,Sorry . I'm just that I think I blew the final and now my parents are going to get all bent out of shape . I like totally drew a blank on everything !
neutral,The bus I took .
neutral,"Oh , I'm terribly sorry , sir . I'll go and get you cola right away ."
neutral,It's not that . There's an animal in my soup .
neutral,I'm really sorry .
neutral,"Oh , I just can't forget it ."
neutral,Thanks . Does it suit me ?
neutral,Excuse me . Have you forgotten our drinks ?
neutral,We are short of staff today .
neutral,I don't think this is fresh .
neutral,"If you could just give us a few more days , we should be able to get this straightened out ."
neutral,"I'm very sorry , sir . I'll bring you a cloth immediately ."
neutral,"No , I'll do it myself ."
neutral,They didn ’ t accept me .
neutral,Are you serious ?
neutral,I want to study abroad .
neutral,Have you got your visa yet ?
neutral,The heart !
neutral,The stomach and intestines !
neutral,"Oh yes , you are right . Very important organs indeed ."
neutral,I'm pretty tired these days .
neutral,Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ?
neutral,"Yes , I do . I ’ ll walk you there ."
neutral,Have you got your visa yet ?
neutral,"I hope to major in English literature , but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year , so we ’ ll see ."
neutral,"Yes , it is . It ’ s also very different from the British education system ."
neutral,"It's my geography , sir . The Map of Africa you set us ."
neutral,"come on , baby . It ’ s time now ."
neutral,Yeah .
neutral,Why don't you speak English ?
neutral,How about tomorrow night ?
neutral,"She's speaking French , not Greek ."
neutral,"You speak good English , though ."
neutral,Are you new here ?
neutral,"Yes , I am ."
neutral,Is this your first year in college ?
neutral,I really like it here so far .
neutral,Do you like it better here or at PCC ?
neutral,I like PCC better .
neutral,I graduated and I'am working towards my next degree .
neutral,"No , I transferred here ."
neutral,What school did you come from ?
neutral,"I wanted to attend this school originally , but my grades out of high school weren ’ t good enough ."
neutral,Of course I ’ m nervous .
neutral,You shouldn ’ t be nervous about that .
neutral,Is this your first year in college ?
neutral,Why did you transfer ?
neutral,Is this your first semester ?
neutral,I just transferred from another school .
neutral,I graduated and now want to get a BA .
neutral,What school did you transfer from ?
neutral,Did you like PCC ?
neutral,I loved PCC .
neutral,You ready ?
neutral,I ’ m not going to know anybody there .
neutral,That ’ s not a problem .
neutral,Where would you like to go to school ?
neutral,I really like where I ’ m at now .
neutral,That may be what I ’ m going to do .
neutral,You ’ re absolutely right .
neutral,What about water pollution instead of pollution ?
neutral,"Hey Sarah , are you all right ? You look upset ."
neutral,"Well , I can tell you from experience that Bob might come off a little strong sometimes ."
neutral,You can always bring up the main points during the meeting and speak to those who are directly involved after the meeting . Not everyone needs to know all that information .
neutral,"Well , I guess Zina figured you couldn't blow it if you were in the hotel room ."
neutral,"Well , at least we have Stars.com . That'll be great publicity ."
neutral,I got your e-mail a couple of months back .
neutral,I just can't right now . Everyone will be talking about Taylor and ...
neutral,... and maybe that's what we both need .
neutral,So he talks about you behind your back ?
neutral,I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort .
neutral,They're probably up front . The preacher's about to speak . Let's listen .
neutral,Hurry up ! Time is money !
neutral,"No . I just like looking at wedding rings , OK ?"
neutral,Come on . She's like that with everyone .
neutral,Harry was angry last night .
neutral,"That's because he's getting nervous . Anyway , this is the first time he's directed a play ."
neutral,Come on . Give it a chance . The movie just started .
neutral,"Oh , don't worry . I just killed a pigeon ."
neutral,"The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ?"
neutral,Why not ?
neutral,"What are you talking about , we tried everything !"
neutral,You won one million yuan in a lottery . What will you say ?
neutral,I'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug .
neutral,There's no need to apologize .
neutral,But I ruined your rug .
neutral,You could try using a spam filter to reject stuff that's obviously pornographic or anything else you don't want .
neutral,Just one moment . I'll check with the cancer ward desk .
neutral,"Yes , ma'am . He died from complications of stomach cancer . I'm very sorry ."
neutral,I'm really sick !
neutral,"No , but Bean did send me like a hundred forwards today . My mailbox must have been overflowing ."
neutral,How obnoxious ! I heard he was sending you dirty jokes .
neutral,Sorry ! Excuse me ! I got your message .
neutral,Time for what ?
neutral,Why not ? I've got the rings ready .
neutral,No . I never sell my artwork .
neutral,"But not as good as your mother's , right ?"
neutral,My older sister Judy will be here soon to help . She already has a boy and a girl of her own ...
neutral,Many of the slower dances are danced to the lyrics of tragedies . He meant that you turned it into a comedy .
neutral,"It's a little early for those , isn't it ? I still have eight months to go ..."
neutral,Did you go to the movie yesterday ?
neutral,I can't think the same .
neutral,My daughter isn't feeling well .
neutral,"Oh , no . Is it serious ?"
neutral,He is fine .
neutral,Forgive me darling . I'm very tired .
neutral,Yes . I have been here for three years .
neutral,Do you like this campus ?
neutral,"Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything ."
neutral,"I , ah ... , I got have late ."
neutral,"Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ?"
neutral,Have you got it now ?
neutral,This morning . I mean ...
neutral,"Oh , I don ’ t care about that ."
neutral,I ’ m afraid I ’ m not interested in fashion .
neutral,We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ?
neutral,Would you like me to give you a lift ?
neutral,Come on . It ’ s no trouble at all .
neutral,You don ’ t like this sort of exercise ?
neutral,"Yes , that ’ s funny . I thought you liked it ."
neutral,It's us .
neutral,"Oh I remember , I cut terrible calls , and you didn't say anything about it ."
neutral,Yes ... thank you for understanding . We have to go now .
neutral,Cut what out I ’ m not doing anything .
neutral,I apologize for their tardiness .
neutral,The mosquitos are biting me !
neutral,"Me , too , I can ’ t stop scratching . They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks ."
neutral,"Thank you , I ’ m doing much better . I ’ Ve begun organizing everything for the funeral ."
neutral,No . Wendy is being cremated . She always talked about how she didn ’ t want to be buried . I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean .
neutral,What do you mean ?
neutral,Why are you so rude to your wife ?
neutral,I know . But I just can't stand her butting in when I was trying to emphasize a point .
neutral,Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ?
neutral,It isn't your fault . No one will blame you .
neutral,I think that ’ s settled .
neutral,"You are blue in the face , arn't you ?"
neutral,I'll beat him .
neutral,"So beat the cat , but don't kill it ."
neutral,What does his dad say ?
neutral,John is a peacemaker . He simply doesn ’ t bother . He says he should give him a free hand .
neutral,What are you talking about ?
neutral,You said it . Many parents just don ’ t know how to educate their children .
neutral,What are you thinking about ?
neutral,About my boyfriend .
neutral,"If I tell you . , you must be completely taken aback ."
neutral,Come on . Tell me what happened .
neutral,Keep your fingers crossed . She'll bring home the bacon .
neutral,"Yeah , I'm eager to learn Chinese , but it is too difficult for me ."
neutral,I'm sure you'll do fine if you try your best .
neutral,"Be confident , and never give up ."
neutral,Yeah . Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian . She's almost driving Li Na crazy .
neutral,I like them very much . They are delicious .
neutral,"Daniel , carrots contain much Vitamin C . It is good for you ."
neutral,"I know , but chocolate cake is even better ."
neutral,"Oh , stop it ! You know you need vegetables . You will end up fat if you don't watch your diet , now ."
neutral,Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene ?
neutral,It really gets me interested . Is it higher than Kiang Shan ?
neutral,That's too bad . Do you have any foreign teachers ?
neutral,What is he like ?
neutral,Would you like to clear the table then ?
neutral,"Not , if you don ’ t want to ."
neutral,Do you love me ?
neutral,I ’ m very fond of you .
neutral,why didn ’ t you answer my question ?
neutral,what question ?
neutral,I don't think so . Dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
neutral,How did Jim get the money ?
neutral,"Oh , my God . I can't take it any more ."
neutral,"Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help ."
neutral,You know you didn't .
neutral,Yes . That would be good .
neutral,"Oh , no ."
neutral,"She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see ."
neutral,Nothing is to your satisfaction .
neutral,Good gracious ! Are you sure ?
neutral,"I am . Whatsmore , his wife is 84 ."
neutral,What a shame !
neutral,That's too bad .
neutral,I'm sorry to hear that .
neutral,What a pity !
neutral,Are you Elvin ?
neutral,You're selling invoking subscriptions like nobody's business . And we don't even have a working demo yet .
neutral,Are you still mad about your nose ? How is it ?
neutral,Don't know what ?
neutral,Just remember . The main thing right now is to make sure Stars.com is happy .
neutral,Did you hear the names he was calling me ?
neutral,What ?
neutral,Then why are you wearing black shoes ?
neutral,Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make .
neutral,I'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
neutral,All right . All right .
neutral,Nothing .
neutral,Why are you feeling depressed ?
neutral,Then forgive her mistake .
neutral,Not a chance .
neutral,She married Jerrod .
neutral,Come on ! Don ’ t be silly !
neutral,Your present job is something better . Why do you change ?
neutral,Well . How do you know ?
neutral,That's too bad .
neutral,how old is she ?
neutral,You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
neutral,I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .
neutral,"It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out ."
neutral,"Hi , Becky , what's up ?"
neutral,It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .
neutral,You said she used to ? How did you stop her ?
neutral,Do you have to leave soon ?
neutral,No . Actually I can stay longer . Dave called to say that there is a beautiful Chinese girl who ’ s going to pick me up at the school gate tonight at ten thirty instead of eight thirty .
neutral,"Oh , that ’ s better . So you don ’ t have to rush ."
neutral,"So Kim , have you ever had anything stolen ?"
neutral,"Stolen ? No , why ?"
neutral,"If your uncle had an alarm system , then it wouldn't have happened ."
neutral,So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
neutral,"Does the class start again , Mam ?"
neutral,Er ... Alison ?
neutral,This machine is out of order .
neutral,Don't worry . I won't .
neutral,I'm signing off .
neutral,It must be Kate .
neutral,"No , I don't think you're right.Kate never does things like that.It must be a naughty boy who did it ."
neutral,"This isn't network , Frida . We are in San Francisco ."
neutral,What's the difference ?
neutral,What can you see from a tram or a double-decker ?
neutral,I can see people who are walking on the sidewalk . I can see cars driving on the streets . I can see the sun shining and beautiful flowers dancing in the wind . I can even smell the scent of flowers and the freshness of the air .
neutral,Don't you want to hear more about my statue ?
neutral,"Oh , do you really think so ?"
neutral,"You're going to abandon me , just like that ?"
neutral,"When shooting a gun , accuracy is very important ."
neutral,Why ?
neutral,"Oh , that ’ s very sad ."
neutral,"Yeah , that ’ s what I told her . I ’ m glad she ’ s reaching out for help , instead of trying to deal with this on her own ."
neutral,"Yeah , me too ."
neutral,You want something to drink ?
neutral,"Hurry , the movie is coming back on ."
neutral,"Then , I'll just trim it ."
neutral,"Yes , but what ’ s the banging noise ?"
neutral,What ’ s happening ?
neutral,"Susan , just one last week I went out to have a lunch with her . There is nothing for you to be jealous about . I like your company much better than Janet ’ s ."
neutral,What ’ s the matter ? Didn ’ t you sleep well last night ?
neutral,"No , I missed it ."
neutral,Someone was in the way .
neutral,"When he told me I had to work overtime , that was it ."
neutral,"Yes , he's really pushed me too far ."
neutral,I know what you mean .
neutral,What ’ s wrong ? Didn ’ t you think it was fun ? !
neutral,"leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law ."
neutral,Would you please put that cigarette out ? I get sick on it .
neutral,"Do you mind if I get a lift in your car , please ?"
neutral,"I ’ m sorry , but I can ’ t find the book that you lend me ."
neutral,"You should be able to find something comfortable in town , though that would be kind of far from school ."
neutral,Would you mind doing something for me ?
neutral,Until next weekend . that ’ s ok .
neutral,Until when ?
neutral,"Yes , I know it . I went through my last set of tires fast . I even had three flat tires in two weeks ."
neutral,Now watch ... some guys probably run a light and hit your car .
neutral,You should have seen the line at the housing office.It took me an hour to make my dormitory deposit for next year . Have you made yours yet ?
neutral,"Well , actually , I am thinking about living off campus ."
neutral,Do you have any idea how much that would cost ?
neutral,I know it would be more expensive . I think I could handle it though . It ’ s that this dorm is so noisy that I can ’ t get anything done .
neutral,Why would I spy on you ?
neutral,"I ’ Ve got this really neat idea , you can hire a car and drive straight there ."
neutral,Well . I am really tired from packing all of the stuff all day . And it's about time to clock out .
neutral,Maybe by then it will be too late .
neutral,"Sorry , but I ’ m not really that interested in those things ."
neutral,"Well , they are very nice you know ."
neutral,"Oh , I don't care about that ."
neutral,Sorry I couldn't help you .
neutral,"Don't be so irritable . I just don't understand the program , that's all ."
neutral,"What if there is no chance ? I mean what if you don't have a partner , what will you do ?"
neutral,"Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ?"
neutral,"Well , come over and talk to me then ."
neutral,"Hey , sorry to be late ."
neutral,"Well , the traffic is very loud . I got no sleep last night ."
neutral,"Oh , I'm so sorry , Sir . I'll see what I can do about that ."
neutral,Thank you . Do you want your money back ?
neutral,I am afraid this is the biggest size we have .
neutral,Maybe you would like to try this one with the willow pattern . The price is the same and it's bigger .
neutral,"Yeas , It is.Sewen Jes speaking.How can I help ?"
neutral,"Actually , I'm calling to complain about your service . The computer I bought last week is faulty ."
neutral,"Oh , I'm sorry to hear that , sir.What exactly is problem ?"
neutral,There ’ s no need to apologize.Forget about it .
neutral,"On , darn . The grocery store is closed ."
neutral,Can I see the receipt ?
neutral,Well ... hum . You are sure you won ’ t lose control of yourself ?
neutral,Alright . What is that you want to tell me ?
neutral,"I don't know . Well , my contract here is for one year , and I don't know what I should do after that . Maybe going around for a while ."
neutral,Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy .
neutral,Didn't I ?
neutral,"Well , I am telling you now ."
neutral,I didn't think you would be interested .
neutral,"Oh , cheer up ! A girlfriend is not everything ."
neutral,"Ok . Next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 AM . At 12 AM , back here for lunch ."
neutral,"Hi , Lander . What's wrong ?"
neutral,I can hardly make ends meet these days .
neutral,Same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months .
neutral,"Yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received a pay rise . It's unfair ."
neutral,We will keep and return it later .
neutral,You can buy them at the souvenir shop near the exit .
neutral,I Don't know how they do it ! Our competitors have undercut us by 10 % percent on the price of our latest model . There is no way will be able to compete against that . We're barely breaking even with the present prices .
neutral,"Yes , sir ?"
neutral,"Yes , may I help you ?"
neutral,"Well , I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ..."
neutral,"No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage.And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time ."
neutral,"Sorry , madam . You have to wait your turn . The parking lot is full ."
neutral,Chill out . It's just Kenny from South Park .
neutral,"I'll give you two clues . First , it cost more than $ 250 . And second , it's not big , but fat ."
neutral,You mean fat boy ?
neutral,"Yeah . Well , I'll see you this weekend ."
neutral,So how do you develop good relationships in the office ?
neutral,"I think one of the important things is just to be considerate of your co-workers'feelings and needs.If you are aware of other people and do your part to make a good working environment , you should be able to get along with most of the people you work with ."
neutral,"I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office ."
neutral,"Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ?"
neutral,I know that magazine . It ’ s very popular .
neutral,"Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her ."
neutral,"Yeah , yeah , yeah ! They wipe out tight , tired feelings and remove lines and age signs . Blah , blah ... See , I can even recite it ."
neutral,"That ’ s ok . If you could just bring it in tomorrow , I would appreciate it ."
neutral,"Definitely , I ’ m really sorry ."
neutral,"No , there is an updated virgin , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes ."
neutral,Look out !
neutral,"Tell me , please ."
neutral,The beauty under the tree ?
neutral,It is still a mystery to me .
neutral,I sure hope you didn't trust anyone with your credit card number .
neutral,"Oh , come on ! I just gave them my e-mail , my address and my phone number . And my name , of course ."
neutral,"Eighty-five dollars . If my bid is the highest after three more days , I win ! It's fun !"
neutral,"But they won't ! I checked the seller's history , and he got good reviews from other buyers ."
neutral,What if he had his friends fake the reviews ?
neutral,That stamp you've been looking for is for sale .
neutral,"Anyhow , this dress is really elegant ."
neutral,This shirt you gave me is not my favorite brand .
neutral,Birds of a feather flock together .
neutral,"fine . I'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet ."
neutral,"you know , I could do this myself . Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?"
neutral,"Oh , no ! I ’ Ve been assigned to work with Jerry for our group project ."
neutral,Let ’ s cross here .
neutral,Now we have to walk all the way down to the end of the street .
neutral,Yeah.Especially when you have something urgent to do .
neutral,But you don't have such a problem as to pop songs .
neutral,Where do they come from ?
neutral,I can't see it .
neutral,"Can you be serious for a moment , we've been dating for 6 months now , I really like you . I'd like to take a relationship to the next level ."
neutral,So what are you trying to say to me ?
neutral,It feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship . It seems like you treat it as a just casual dating .
neutral,I don't want to be like this . I think we should get step further .
neutral,Yeah.He never stops asking questions .
neutral,"you can also take her to the art museum or a cafe . Certainly , i must come up with something you can use . how do you like the ideas i am giving you ?"
neutral,"When I booked the room , your staff didn ’ t mention this . And the brochure and your promotional mailings do not mention that ."
neutral,Are you quite sure ?
neutral,Maybe you should think about moving .
neutral,"To be honest , Ava , I've just had a really bad day ."
neutral,What happened ?
neutral,"First , I slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work ."
neutral,What are you going to do ?
neutral,Thank you . But I ’ m sorry I ’ m in a bad mood at the moment .
neutral,How come ?
neutral,Hurry up . Time is running out .
neutral,I ran into a glass door yesterday .
neutral,Come on . It ’ s quite safe . You really have no guts .
neutral,nothing really . I think I've had a few too many coffees .
neutral,"yes , everything is fine ."
neutral,"turbulence is pretty normal , isn't it ?"
neutral,"yes , but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life ! Everyone started getting sick . The flight attendants had to stay in their seats . The captain decided to land early ."
neutral,"it looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again ."
neutral,"the heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer !"
neutral,the brakes don't really work that well anymore either .
neutral,why don't you get it all fixed ?
neutral,"it costs more than you think to run a car , especially when there are so many things wrong with it !"
neutral,"so , how should we go to the theatre ?"
neutral,it's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .
neutral,"we could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice ."
neutral,"if we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?"
neutral,it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes .
neutral,I was not born yesterday .
neutral,did you get my email ?
neutral,sure .
neutral,I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets !
neutral,"well , my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ?"
neutral,"Did you get any pizza ? When I got there , only small one was left . What a pity !"
neutral,I am so sorry that I must be off now . My girlfriend told me I must arrive at her home in ten minutes or she will break up with me .
neutral,Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ?
neutral,"Talk to him , try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn ’ t work , I say get rid of him and get a new one !"
neutral,"Yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars ."
neutral,What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
neutral,"There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick ."
neutral,"C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box ."
neutral,"You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?"
neutral,"... Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter , Ed ! Give us some good news . How are things looking for us in terms sales this month ?"
neutral,"hey , Tom , did you enjoy your lunch ?"
neutral,what ' the matter ?
neutral,"yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district ."
neutral,that's true .
neutral,"yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle , don't you ?"
neutral,"yeah , it's hard to believe but true ."
neutral,my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .
neutral,yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .
neutral,you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .
neutral,how ?
neutral,"I will come clean as soon as we get to safety , OK ? For now , you have to trust me , please ! I would never do anything to hurt you ."
neutral,"I haven ’ t been completely honest with you Veronica , I ’ m sorry . I ’ m not a fireman . I ’ m not even from the United States . I ’ m a spy for the Indian government ."
neutral,"Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , butoften times I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine ."
neutral,Would you like another one ?
neutral,"You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill ."
neutral,Try to be more careful in future .
neutral,But i do not like anyone touch my head .
neutral,"They are just been in friendly , when you are in Roman , do as the Romans do , that means you need to adapt to your enviroment ."
neutral,Will you be checking any bags today .
neutral,"Those are possible problems , but tell me , when you turn the key , do you hear the starter motor crank ?"
neutral,So what do you think it is ?
neutral,Hi Isabel ! You wanted to see me ?
neutral,Is everything okay ? You seem a bit preoccupied .
neutral,Okay ...
neutral,And ?
neutral,And it's a brick ?
neutral,"I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new ."
neutral,"Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new ."
neutral,"You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?"
neutral,"Well , that seems easy enough ."
neutral,Um ... no .
neutral,Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ?
neutral,I guess .
neutral,"I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ?"
neutral,"No , I forgot to buy some ."
neutral,Run ! They are thirsty for more !

neutral,Did he leave when you left ?
neutral,Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile .
neutral,"Hi , Bob , everything okay ?"
neutral,you refused the gift ? That's terrible .
neutral,"I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way ."
neutral,I tried before . There are no buttons on the air conditioning .
neutral,There must be buttons . How do they turn it on and off ?
neutral,They said it is centrally controlled.All the rooms are the same . They can't change it .
neutral,It seems that yesterday the Mexican government declared wouldn't pay back the loans it got from the World Bank.The government declared a default on the loans .
neutral,"Yes , it's an amazing drop ."
neutral,What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
neutral,"I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new ."

neutral,I'm so busy . I don't know how will get this done .
neutral,"So , you ’ re applying for a B2 visa , where is your final destination and what ’ s the purpose of your trip to the United States ?"
neutral,And how long do you you plan to remain in the United States ?
neutral,That's because you cheated .
neutral,"Yes , you do ."
neutral,"Don ’ t worry about it , just drive . Oh , no , the light is about to change . . . step on it !"
neutral,"Yes ! We made it . 5:58 , just before the library closes ."
neutral,"Yeah . It ’ s pretty cold , alright ."

neutral,"I had one or two glasses of eggnog , but nothing else ."

neutral,Do you have the five dollars I lent you yesterday ?
neutral,"I know you're sleepy and I hate to bother you , but I think you're late for work ."
neutral,When do you go ?
neutral,Wouldn't that take you away from your project ?

neutral,What's your favorite magazine ?
neutral,"No , but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow ."
neutral,Can you do push-ups ?
neutral,"Of course I can . It's a piece of cake ! Believe it or not , I can do 30 push-ups a minute ."

neutral,I am considering going for the new job that was posted yesterday .
neutral,I believe that this job would allow me to move up but might be a little boring for me .
neutral,I was wondering if I could borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend .
neutral,I think that would be OK . Who will be driving it ?
neutral,"Our unit is participating in a fundraiser this weekend and would like to borrow the van , if possible ."

neutral,Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like ?
neutral,"It was . Let's stick with the regular choices today , though ."
neutral,"Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ?"
neutral,How come ?
neutral,"Well , it would give me a chance to grow , but I am wondering if I would like the job ."

neutral,Did you know it takes two to tango ?
neutral,I think so .
neutral,"Yes , I did . It is a horrible movie ."
neutral,He's too young for the job .
neutral,AC Milan versus Real Madrid .
neutral,It is hard to guess now . Both of the teams chose the excellent players this time . I guess the game will end in a tie . They are equally matched .
neutral,He quit
neutral,I called in sick .
neutral,I can't go to your party .
neutral,What ?
neutral,I dare you to talk to that girl .
neutral,"Oh , it's a disco . Let's dance ."

neutral,But I heard it might rain .
neutral,I'd rather you didn't .
neutral,Would you like to go to a concert with me ?
neutral,Dress casually .
neutral,You are so old-fashioned . I have already watched it last week in cinema .
neutral,How was it ?
neutral,It is said that The Hurt Locker got the Award of Best Picture . What do you think about this ?
neutral,Tim's always bothering me .
neutral,He got a scolding .
neutral,Search me .
neutral,You always stick to your PC recently . Are you still fascinated by chatting on line ?

neutral,"Now everything is OK . I can write my blog , right ?"
neutral,Are you free tonight ?

neutral,"Correct ! What about you , Fred ?"
neutral,"Excuse me , could you tell me how much is the ticket ?"
neutral,I have no idea . Maybe I will sleep for the whole day .
neutral,Are you sure ?
neutral,What's your meaning ?
neutral,"You mean it is a still virtual game . Your friends steal your vegetables time and time again , and you take theirs as well , right ?"
neutral,"You got what I meant . Perhaps , what I steal are not vegetables , but loneliness ."
neutral,"I stole many from Fred's farm , and from yours . I planned to have a dog on farm ."
neutral,How much do you want ?
neutral,"We'll get a big bonus this year , won't we ?"
neutral,Rob lost his bike .

neutral,What do you mean ?
neutral,"Yes , you are right ."
neutral,I've heard so much about Japan . Is it a beautiful country ?
neutral,"Not everyone thinks Japan is beautiful , but to me its beauty is breathtaking.You feel the same way about France , don't you ?"
neutral,I quit my job .
neutral,Are you deaf or what ?
neutral,Let's go to a ETV tonight .
neutral,But I can't sing it well .

neutral,I'm feeling a little under the weather .
neutral,"No , thanks . I'm full ."
neutral,A new car for a start .
neutral,What brings you to Beijing ?
neutral,Why are you laughing ?
neutral,I can't help it .
neutral,There will be a party in my company ; what shall I wear ?
neutral,"In that case , formal suit with a nice tie will be better ."
neutral,"Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ?"
neutral,"When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports ."
neutral,Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo .
neutral,You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too .
neutral,Sure . What about you ? What do you like about the Olympics ?
neutral,"For me , the Olympics for the disabled always catches my heart . It makes me understand that perseverance makes the impossible possible ."
neutral,"Belinda , I ’ m going to a party tonight . What shall I wear ?"
neutral,It ’ ll be too late ; you ’ d better take a taxi .
neutral,OK .
neutral,"Sorry , I don't smoke ."
neutral,"If you gotta go , you gotta go ."
neutral,"Hmm ... Oh , this one , ' The Drunken Beauty ' . This is a real classic ."
neutral,"Sure , people do that when they are drunk . What about the actress ?"
neutral,"You know , interest is the best teacher ."
neutral,"I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait ."
neutral,Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art . ( They come to the museum of the Beijing Opera art . )
neutral,I surely do . They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that .
neutral,"No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework ."
neutral,Very few can . That's why these clothes only appear in the museum .
neutral,What a pity !
neutral,There is a wonderful opera today . I'd like to see it .
neutral,"' The sound of music ' . This music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages . It is about a happy family without sex , violence or bad language ."

neutral,Oh Jackie ? We broke up last week .
neutral,What do you mean ?
neutral,She sounds very emotional .
neutral,Were you suppose to be there ?
neutral,Ok . You're right . She's a psycho .
neutral,How was the party last night ? Did you enjoy it ?
neutral,What about the party ?
neutral,So how long did you stay ?
neutral,Do you like plum blossoms ?
neutral,"I know , but I've done that so Ay times . It's getting old . The leading guy is always the same macho A ."
neutral,Next time . You are going to love your part . I've seen the script .
neutral,Aah ! Close your eyes . You aren't supposed to see this .
neutral,That's a very good hint .
neutral,"Well , in fact it's fun for us to just be together that night and do this one thing ."
neutral,I guess the spirit of it is what really makes any tradition fun .
neutral,You should be there some Christmas Eve .
neutral,"How can you tell the difference ? From what I see , they look almost the same ."
neutral,( Later .. ) Everything looks tempting . What do you want to have ?
neutral,Pardon ?
neutral,Do you see that girl in the red top ? She told me who you were .

neutral,Here we are . You find us a table and I'll get the drinks .
neutral,Would you like to come over for dinner tonight ?
neutral,What eye shadow do you think is the most fit for me ?
neutral,How do you protect yourself from chapped lips ?
neutral,Did you hear about Neil ?
neutral,Not yet . Let's go to that restaurant on the corner .
neutral,"Okay . In the middle of their streets there are parks , big soccer fields as far as you can see ."
neutral,"I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ?"
neutral,That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
neutral,"First , I worked as a servant ."
neutral,Really ? I wish you could tell me more about your experience .
neutral,"I'd like to , but I must run to a meeting ."
neutral,What are you reading ? You've had your nose buried in that book since last night .
neutral,Don't tell me anything about it . I want to read it for myself .
neutral,I'll participate in a quiz about the 29th Olympic Games in Beijing . It will be held tonight . Will you come ?
neutral,Sure .
neutral,How do you feel about teaching my friend how to read ?
neutral,Come on . You're great at teaching and I know you will love him . He's adorable !
neutral,Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
neutral,They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest .
neutral,"Well , I'm under a lot of pressure . My boss is very pushy . He assigned me two projects . Now the deadlines are near and I still haven't finish one of them ."
neutral,I know your feeling . Take it easy .
neutral,"And where are you from , Jack ?"
neutral,"When I was a kid , there was a weather who said there is no such thing as bad weather ."
neutral,"Well , for one , we have an excuse to stay home ."
neutral,We ' get ' to stay home ? Do you know something that I don't ?
neutral,Mind your own business .
neutral,Is that right ?
neutral,"I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale ."
neutral,I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection .
neutral,"Well , I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made , so I couldn't afford to buy any new ties ."
neutral,"Anyways , are you going to the party tonight ?"
neutral,"Yes , I am . Say , are you going to wear that outfit to the party ?"
neutral,I don't think so . It is a little too formal . I'm probably going to wear something more laid back .
neutral,"Susan , I haven't seen you in the pub for a long time ."
neutral,His girlfriend broke up with him .
neutral,Good for you ! What are you doing ?
neutral,Yeah . It's beautiful . Is it white gold or silver ?
neutral,Do you have any year-end benefits ?
neutral,What about ?
neutral,That was quick thinking .
neutral,What kind of watch is it ?
neutral,It's really late but I'm starving .
neutral,Maybe they have some good pie .
neutral,Mmmm . That sounds like something I had in Mexico once .
neutral,"Good stuff ... Oh , no . The door is locked ."
neutral,I did . Let me go get it for you . Here you go .
neutral,The one in the red shirt ?
neutral,Why don't you go talk to her ?
neutral,"He's the US president , who walked five miles just to give a lady her change , isn't he ?"
neutral,"Hey , let's arm wrestle !"
neutral,Not now .
neutral,Thought about what ?
neutral,I don't know . You should know how she's going to react . She is your girlfriend .
neutral,That would be the real proof . Didn't we have to show ID to get on the plane ?
neutral,"Actually , I've told them a lot about you . They are excited to meet you ."
neutral,Let's see . there's my mom and dad and my two brothers and one of my sisters .
neutral,Peter Madsen . A great A if I do say so myself .
neutral,I played outfield . I hated the infield because I never figured out all the bounces .
neutral,"I wish I could play again , but there isn't much opportunities around here ."
neutral,Are you a football player ?
neutral,"We won't have much time , so let's play somewhere close to work ."
neutral,Can I borrow your Cds for our school dance ?
neutral,Let's do something really nice for our family this Christmas .
neutral,What did you have in mind ?
neutral,I just know I want to get out of the mindless gift trap .
neutral,"Actually , I can do both soprano and alto but the director asked me to sing alto for the next perforate . What about you ."
neutral,Let's hope it clears up .
neutral,"Hello , this is David ."
neutral,Does five thirty work for you ?
neutral,Yes . I just need to double check a few details with you .
neutral,Probably my parents .
neutral,How so ?
neutral,Your parents are not like that ?
neutral,"Not much I can do . It's always there . I sometimes go out with some friends and drink , but that's only a temporary solution . The stress always returns in the morning ."
neutral,What other activities will you have tomorrow ?
neutral,"Quite a lot . The celebration of the New Year has just started . The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the North have Jiaozi . Afterward , we will make New Year calls on family relatives , husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second ."
neutral,I hope so .
neutral,You don't have to .
neutral,I'll double check the announcement .
neutral,"He's been compared to Rimbaud , you know ."
neutral,Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ?
neutral,"Both actually . S , Y , B , I , L ."
neutral,Do you have a copy of our service contract with Telecoms ? I'm not happy with their response time and I'd like to check the terms and conditions of the contract .
neutral,It should take at least 20 minutes to get there . Are there any shuttle buses running place to place around the whole zoo ?
neutral,I don't know how old he is though .
neutral,My name is Phil . What's yours ?
neutral,Alecia .
neutral,We're having a tailgate party I before the game . Would you like to join us ?

neutral,Don't worry about it ! Just come at five .
neutral,I make a mean potato salad !
neutral,How Ay clients do you have already ?
neutral,"Well , I've been in business for one month now and I have ten clients ."
neutral,The bright people will remember it forever .
neutral,Didn't you notice the roses everywhere ?
neutral,Why are you so quiet ?
neutral,"You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover ."
neutral,"Bill , do you know when did the Chinese begin to celebrate Teachers ' Day ?"
neutral,I know the Chinese teachers had their first festival in 1985 .
neutral,"So , it is the 27th Teachers ' Day ."
neutral,I intend to invite him to dinner .
neutral,Hey Jack . How's it going ?
neutral,Did you guys go on a date already ?
neutral,"When my grandmother passed away , I frequently visited her in the cemetery . I always talked to her . Even though she wasn't there , I somehow knew she heard what I said ."
neutral,I will dress up as a vampire with big fangs .
neutral,May I have a look at your costume ?
neutral,Sure . Wait a moment . ( Several minutes later ) Here you are .
neutral,What a jerk . He doesn't deserve you .
neutral,It must be really painful . I remember when Josh and I broke up . I was crying for a week .
neutral,When do you celebrate Thanksgiving ?
neutral,I hope so .
neutral,I'll have supper with my girlfriend and go shopping . What about you ?
neutral,"I already told you , because Julia Roberts is in it . I like her because she is not only a great actor but also is very generous to give a lot to many kinds of charities ."
neutral,"Well , it can cause smog , which can affect people's health - especially people with breathing difficulties ."
neutral,"Tom is a kind guy , but addicted to gambling . He spends all his time gambling in the casino . And his wife can't put up with his incessant gambling any longer , so she divorced him . Is that right ?"
neutral,Someone declared that he saw it .
neutral,So what does that have to do with this position ?
neutral,"I mean Internet brings benefit a lot , but also some disadvantages . For example , many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study ; or some bad guys steal people's money online , etc ."
neutral,"Oh , the car is old but still in good condition . I just think we should be thrifty , whether you are rich or not ."
neutral,Maybe you are right .
neutral,It was a foreign film called ' Gone with the wind ' .
neutral,How did you like the movie ?
neutral,I can't say I agree .
neutral,It might be .

neutral,Wang Min . Telephone number is 13811658 . Can I pick the tickets this afternoon ?
neutral,How do you like it ?
neutral,"I expected too high from that movie , but I was a bit disappointed about it ."
neutral,It tells the lifetime of a lady singer from a beggar in the street to a famous singer in the world . It is a kind of tragedy .
neutral,Who's that man over there talking to James ?
neutral,"Where ? Oh , that's Henry ."
neutral,"Well , haven't you heard ?"
neutral,"Let's go to see a war movie , shall we ?"
neutral,"Sorry , we have sold out the tickets ."
neutral,"Yes , 20 yuan for each ."
neutral,Can I help you ?
neutral,Just two .
neutral,Will you give your friends a buzz and put out a feeler to see if they like to offer me a loan ?

neutral,Look . It's begin .
neutral,Do you have concert halls in your city ?
neutral,Definitely . I need to have enough time to have a rest on this weekend . We worked like bees in the whole working days .

neutral,Certainly .
neutral,"Hello , is this People's Theater ?"
neutral,"Yes , it is . May I help you ?"

neutral,"My mom phoned me this morning , and asked me to go back home to have housework chores ."

neutral,For killing time and making new friends .
neutral,Moderate exercise is really important for health . ' Life lies in movement . '
neutral,"Hi , Ben . Come in . Diane's not ready yet , so you'll have to wait a few minutes ."
neutral,I'm not sure yet . And you ?
neutral,Is skating interesting ?
neutral,I have had enough gin fizz and bloody mary . But I have no idea about Chinese cocktails .
neutral,I expect all Chinese can play table tennis .
neutral,Do you like playing table tennis ?
neutral,"Come on , Ted , don't be such a chicken . If you like her , you've got to tell her . Maybe she likes you ."
neutral,"Well , I don't have the guts to ask her out ."
neutral,OK .
neutral,"OK , I want you to be happy when we are together , and when you are sad , I would always stay with you ."
neutral,"When I am angry and want to beat someone , you stand there and let me do what I want . Would you ?"
neutral,Didn't you say you were planning a trip to China ? I heard the northwest and north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms !
neutral,"I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but let's try to forget that and be friends ."
neutral,"Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter ."
neutral,You don't look too well . What's going on ?
neutral,"For me , I think starting school was more exciting ."
neutral,What ?
neutral,The wonderful passing Melaena did .
neutral,Too bad I missed it .
neutral,"Why ? In my opinion , it doesn't matter whether you won or not . The most important thing is participation ."
neutral,I still think nobody plays for nothing .
neutral,"What's up , buddy ? You look so upset ."
neutral,I'm sorry to hear that . What's your conflict ?
neutral,Did you think about talking to her again ? Maybe she is waiting for your call .
neutral,"According to the papers , the visiting side is a strong team in America ."
neutral,What do you think of the former champ ?
neutral,I suppose he's not in top form .
neutral,I hear you're going to Tainan to visit your uncle .
neutral,What sort of job do you have in mind ?
neutral,I don't care .
neutral,What do you do now ?
neutral,I'm out of work at the moment .
neutral,I was fired last week .
neutral,What's your plan now ?
neutral,I heard that Kevin got divorced . Is that true ?
neutral,His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion .
neutral,Can you tell which team seems to win ?
neutral,They're still fighting hard . Let's wait and see .
neutral,Hello !
neutral,I'm from Madras .
neutral,The Ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .
neutral,"In the discus throw , you scored 30 meters at the final throw . How did you make it ?"
neutral,"No , once I did 32 ."
neutral,I think he deserved his gold .
neutral,Me too .
neutral,Where did you go ? You've got a beautiful tan .
neutral,"And I taught him how to swim in the sea . It was fun and made him braver than before . After we returned home , he wasn't afraid to sleep alone in his bedroom ."
neutral,But the Brazilian is tougher .
neutral,"Well , winter is a season for relaxation , do you agree with me ?"
neutral,Maybe you are right .
neutral,"But it's an expensive hobby , isn't it ?"
neutral,"Yes , you're right . What do you like to do in your spare time ?"
neutral,"Hey , Mary , what's up ?"
neutral,"Well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! And we have so much in common . We like the same team , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends ."
neutral,What do you like to do in your spare time ?
neutral,Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ?
neutral,Maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much !
neutral,It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing . What's wrong with us ?
neutral,"I already tried to call up some of the guys , but they are all busy ."
neutral,What's the temperature ?
neutral,Me too . How's the weather where you are ?
neutral,"No , not really . When I left Vietnam , I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years . Where do you work , Alice ?"
neutral,I am an accountant at a company .
neutral,I heard that it's supposed to get up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit today .
neutral,"Judge from his look , he's a very serious person ."
neutral,"As a matter of fact , he is ."
neutral,There's nothing to watch right now .
neutral,Did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
neutral,Oh yeah . I heard about that too . Let's go check it out .
neutral,It starts at one PM .
neutral,I'm doing great .
neutral,I hate the hot weather . I'd rather stay indoors with the air conditioner .
neutral,Out of those what is your favorite ?
neutral,What is your favorite computer game ?
neutral,I am going to go to the bookstore .
neutral,Yeah . What's going on ?
neutral,"It's hard work while exercising , but it is a great feeling when I get done ."
neutral,"I have a running machine at home . I used to use it , but I already got sick of it ."
neutral,Exercising at home is hard . The environment is not suited for exercising .
neutral,"Oh , not yet . At least have one for the road ."
neutral,"No , thanks all the same ."
neutral,Certainly .
neutral,"So Irene , what do you do ?"
neutral,Who's that tall guy over there ?
neutral,"Oh , that's George . He looks very drunk ."
neutral,"Oh , he's really reserved , normally . But , from what I hear , he's got lots of problems ."
neutral,"Well , off the record , of course , but I hear that he's got terrible debts . He has his own company , and it's not going very well ."
neutral,"Hm ? Oh , that's Alice . She's totally mad . Don't get yourself in a room alone with her ."
neutral,"Oh , while we're on the subject , what happened to you and your secretary ?"
neutral,I have no idea what you're talking about .
neutral,Could you excuse me a moment ? I have to make a phone call
neutral,But for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am .
neutral,You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying ' hello ' to her .
neutral,What wish do you make ?
neutral,"Yes , I do ."
neutral,I hope I can stay here longer .
neutral,When will your vacation end ?
neutral,Perhaps because of the dirty air .
neutral,Are you going to get married in the church ?
neutral,Swimming . What about you ?
neutral,May I have two tickets for Tiny Times ?
neutral,"It's 60 yuan , please ."
neutral,"Sorry , we have student cards . We can get discounts with these , can't we ?"
neutral,"Well , those books are really good . I like them too . How do you entertain yourself ?"
neutral,"Yes , but I don't really use it often . Have you ever used it ?"
neutral,"Jenny , I was wondering if you , um ... are you busy this Friday ?"
neutral,"Hi , Linda . I have two concert complimentary tickets . Will you go with me tonight ?"
neutral,"It's been a week , and I haven't slept that well ."
neutral,Have you thought about wearing a hat ?
neutral,"Well , it's one way to get through the in-betweens if you really want to grow it out !"
neutral,"Alright , now let's be serious . Actually , you get high marks in the exam ."
neutral,I want to take Shield on a date but I don't have much money .
neutral,Hmm . Sounds like she has pretty pricey tastes .
neutral,Do you have any hobbies besides playing chess ?
neutral,Because I like the feeling of cooperating with others .
neutral,That's the style ! You just wear boxers .
neutral,"Mine are wet , too ."
neutral,She wished good luck to you .
neutral,Uh-oh . We don't have a flashlight .
neutral,They must have just come back from tomb sweeping because today is Tomb Sweeping Day .
neutral,"Tomb Sweeping Day is a traditional festival in China , on which many Chinese mourn the dead ."
neutral,What do they do ?
neutral,This city is far too polluted . We should do something about it .
neutral,Don't you know ? Tomorrow is Father's Day .
neutral,"You also need to choose a gift for your father , right ?"
neutral,I do . I don't know what to do after I retire . I'd like to work till I drop .
neutral,We celebrate it to commemorate a great patriotic poet of China — Qu Yuan .
neutral,Would you like to join the drama club ?
neutral,Sure .
neutral,"No problem , but you've got to be careful ."
neutral,My Chinese friends told me that the Spring Festival is coming soon . Can you tell me something about it ?
neutral,"Yes , just like Christmas in western countries , it is a time for eating lots of special food ."
neutral,"Yeah , so I have to buy presents for everyone before I leave ."
neutral,The cold weather will damage the engine .
neutral,Cheer up ! It's not the end of the world .
neutral,Do you have any hobbies ?
neutral,What kind of things do you paint ?
neutral,"My favorite winter sport is skiing . In addition , I am keen on basketball ."
neutral,Do you have any hobbies ?
neutral,Can you read what this says ?
neutral,"Hey , that's enough about my hair ."
neutral,I know a great hairdresser not far from here and she is cute too .
neutral,"Come on , Brenda ! Never say die ."
neutral,"Yes . How are you , Anna ?"
neutral,"Hi , Jim and Wendy . Where're you going ?"
neutral,"Are you free tomorrow , Sam ?"
neutral,"Yeah , what's up ?"
neutral,"You look great ! However , I think you are a little over dressed for dinner ."
neutral,Didn't they say we're going to the Ritz ?
neutral,Hey Sarah . Why are you limping ?
neutral,Did you hear what happened to Mike in Accounts ?
neutral,"Well , anyway , he'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys , so he couldn't get in . He lives alone , you know ."
neutral,"What do you mean his grandmothers are already dead ? Wait a minute , you don't think he's avoiding me , do you ?"
neutral,"Oh man , I hate rejection . It really makes you feel terrible , especially when you really liked the person ."
neutral,"Well , apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . Typical , isn't it ?"
neutral,Did you have a good weekend ?
neutral,"Yes , thanks . Did you ?"
neutral,I went to Tamshui . You ?
neutral,Not bad .
neutral,"First of all , you must be punctual . You should be there before 6 p . m . so that you will have half an hour for preparation changing clothes and things like that . Then , remember you should smile . Smile to your customers all the time . Never pull a long face even If you feel awful that day . Anything else ? Oh , yes . Never argue with your boss . Learn to say ' Yes , sir . '"
neutral,What ’ s the score ?
neutral,What's the big deal ? It's just a picture of some woman .
neutral,There are tons of other paintings that I think are better .
neutral,Are you busy next Saturday ?
neutral,"Hello , Janet ."
neutral,"Good morning , Pete ."
neutral,And what is this ?
neutral,"Ah , this is my daughter's birthday present . Her birthday is next week ."
neutral,That is not for a while . His birthday is only in August .
neutral,"So Emily , do you still want to see a movie together this weekend ?"
neutral,"Sure , more elegant and taller ."
neutral,"If I were your date , I would be so charmed by you ."
neutral,Would you like orchestra seats ?
neutral,What do you think about violence in movies ?
neutral,Have you found a suitable job ?
neutral,"No , I'm afraid that's it ."
neutral,I really don't like the winter . I wish it were summer .
neutral,"Give me Scotch , please ."
neutral,Did you do anything fun over the weekend ?
neutral,Why didn't you want to go out ?
neutral,I downloaded it so that I didn't have to remember to return it .
neutral,"Oh yeah , that sounds pretty cool , I guess ..."
neutral,Hi Vicky .
neutral,I just got off the subway . I'm almost there . Sorry I'm late .
neutral,Come upstairs .
neutral,What do you want to do ?
neutral,"Good evening , sir . What can I do for you ?"
neutral,"With iced water , please ."
neutral,The movie theater is always so crowded on the weekends . I like to go to the movies during the week .
neutral,"I like watching comedies , like ' Boat ' . Do you like watching comedies too ?"
neutral,"Not really . It's a dull one , and the production isn't satisfactory , either ."
neutral,Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up .
neutral,Come on . She's like that with everyone .
neutral,"From mid-November , snow started to pile up in Ottawa ."
neutral,"I'd like to , but I'm not sure if I can . Work has been really busy lately . Why don't we go on Friday instead ?"
neutral,"There is too much traffic in Taipei these days , I think cars should be banned ."
neutral,I'm not sure about that . How would people get to work ?
neutral,"Well , why not use buses or the MET ?"
neutral,Would you please tell me something about the agriculture and industry of New Zealand ?
neutral,The agriculture in New Zealand is highly mechanized . The industry mainly focuses on the manufacture of agriculture and stockbreeding products .
neutral,What do you do ?
neutral,Circle or stalls ?
neutral,Stalls .
neutral,"Well , ' Terminator ' is a really great action movie , and I like action movies because they're exciting ."
neutral,"Actually , I have to admit that you're right . I like some pretty cheesy movies too . I love Arnold Schwarzenegger action flicks , especially "" Terminator . """
neutral,"I don't like ads , either . But ads could bring big profits to the TV station ."
neutral,How about recycling ? Does that actually help ?
neutral,"Yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center ."
neutral,"On top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city ."
neutral,People always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .
neutral,"I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place ."
neutral,"Oh , is that next week ?"
neutral,Yes . Did you forget ?
neutral,Sure . Does she know your friend ?
neutral,"Yes . I'll pick you up first , and then we'll go get Megan ."
neutral,That's a good school . What do you study ?
neutral,That's a long time .
neutral,I'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door .
neutral,"No , of course not . Just in case . Nothing to worry about . Don't you also do this in China ?"
neutral,Why do all girls appear feminine after sophomore year ?
neutral,I feel they all talk and behave in a different way .
neutral,Got it . Can we see any things left by them ?
neutral,"Not as much as last time , actually . What's the name of the American actor who was in the supporting role ?"
neutral,Does your brother have just one son ?
neutral,"No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them ."
neutral,So when are they all coming ?
neutral,Then what should I do ?
neutral,"No , I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ?"
neutral,How many people are there in your family ?
neutral,Eighteen .
neutral,Do you miss your family ?
neutral,Nothing really .
neutral,What's on these days ?
neutral,I think they're playing Lord of the Rings
neutral,Why don't you like horror ? They're entertaining .
neutral,Is uncle Bill your brother ?
neutral,And when are they coming to visit us ?
neutral,I would think this was the least they could do .
neutral,How did you get into hip hop ?
neutral,"Yes , me too . I mostly listen to hip hop , but there are many genres of music I like ."
neutral,"That's great . Did you start dating right after you met , or did you become friends first ?"
neutral,"No , what ?"
neutral,Crikey . Where did this happen ?
neutral,So what happened ?
neutral,"Well , he drove out , and when he got to the booth to pay the attendant , he pretended to have an epileptic fit , you know , to scare the thieves away . The attendant was no help at all , even though the guys were holding guns in plain view , he did nothing ."
neutral,"Yes , makes you think , doesn't it ?"
neutral,So what happened next ?
neutral,"Hmm ... Vanilla Ice ? I know his most famous song , "" Ice Ice Baby , "" but I don't know his other songs ."
neutral,So you met her right after you got to school ?
neutral,That's right . We've been dating since last September .
neutral,Did he tell you what she was like first ?
neutral,"Yes , and the driver didn't speak any English or Chinese and he didn't have a phone on him-can you believe it ? - and his radio didn't work . So there was no way he could get in touch with the office to get them to send another taxi ."
neutral,"Yes , I stood on the side of the freeway and stuck my thumb out , and a passing truck stopped and took me to the airport ."
neutral,So they met up at the start of the journey and showed each other their equipment .
neutral,"You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football ."
neutral,I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team .
neutral,What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ?
neutral,"Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates ."
neutral,The Rockets .
neutral,"Oh , do you go hiking often ?"
neutral,Not bad . Thank you . You look great today . And how is your husband ?
neutral,"Yes , why ?"
neutral,"So Jen , what did you think of William ? Did you guys have a nice time on your first date ?"
neutral,"Yes , it's fine . However , I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . Don't they have carts ?"
neutral,What ?
neutral,"Well , that's probably true , but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it . A colleague of mine was kidnapped once , so perhaps I have a different view of things ."
neutral,"Well , it was in the Balkans during the war . He was only held for three days , and then they simply released him . It was a case of mistaken identity , and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . It was lucky they didn't kill him ."
neutral,"Well I hate to tell you this Jen , but both of William's grandmothers passed away more than five years ago ."
neutral,Have you heard when it's supposed to get better ?
neutral,"Yes , I'm very busy , too . Sometimes I work overtime ."
neutral,Then your salary must be high .
neutral,"Good , thanks . How about you ?"
neutral,But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages ?
neutral,May be I can have a try . But I'm on vacation now .
neutral,"Yeah . It's already December , you know ."
neutral,OK . See you later .
neutral,Are you feel tired ?
neutral,Sometimes . News happened out of expectation . Sometimes I have to get up in the early morning while I can't sleep for editing and interviewing .
neutral,How about Legally Blonde .
neutral,"Well , I have the day off from work ."
neutral,Mmm .
neutral,Yes . What did you think of it ?
neutral,I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it.What did you think of it ?
neutral,What ’ s wrong ? That was a great goal .
neutral,Too bad .
neutral,I'm just watching some television .
neutral,That's right . What do you think we should do as a hobby ?
neutral,Say what you want to say .
neutral,"You see . The wage is not paid yet , I am wondering if you could possibly lend me some money ."
neutral,About two months .
neutral,But I prefer warm weather .
neutral,What do you do when you are angry ?
neutral,What day is today ?
neutral,Life's so boring .
neutral,"Well , most of the time it is , I guess ."
neutral,I think money will make me happy .
neutral,You heard people say that money doesn't guarantee happiness .
neutral,"You see ... money doesn't equal happiness , but it takes away a lot of responsibilities ."
neutral,I didn't realize it was so difficult though I know I'm always too nervous in such competition .
neutral,It doesn't matter . Forget it .
neutral,I don't think I performed well .
neutral,"Yes , yes . She said she is going to stop drinking coffee too and quit all the unhealthy habits just for the baby ."
neutral,Yes . Is it wrong to lie to them even if it is for their good ?
neutral,"Yes , but I'm not sure what exactly I would need ."
neutral,When are you going to tell her that Santa Claus doesn't exist ?
neutral,"Hello , Susan , it ’ s me , An ."
neutral,"Hi , An . How are you ?"
neutral,I don't quite remember . Why did you ask that ?
neutral,"Yes . Fortunately , I had my cell with me this morning . I called the police as I was running to get people to come to help ."
neutral,Was it quite special ?
neutral,"Oh , your classmates took you in ."
neutral,We have another traditional holiday-the Dragon Boat Festival .
neutral,Why do people eat rice cakes on that day ?
neutral,How do your spend your time after work or in vacation ?
neutral,Any plans tonight ?
neutral,"That's strange . But probably , it is the new interview technique they call it ' Getting to know you more personally ' . What about your answers ?"
neutral,I hope so . We have planed to visit the square but we have to cancel it .
neutral,Why not send them short messages ?
neutral,You needn't ask anyone . You can get on line to search for one .
neutral,What's that ?
neutral,"By the way , where are you going on New Year's Eve ?"
neutral,"Yes . Speaking of digital wares , I bought a digital camera last week ."
neutral,Please come in for a cup of coffee .
neutral,"Yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . Please get in ."
neutral,"It's getting late , and I have to go now ."
neutral,"Please excuse me , won't you ?"
neutral,That sounds interesting . Which is the nearest ?
neutral,For instance ?
neutral,There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission . It seemed to fizzle out . Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner ?
neutral,"I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair , that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on . But only time will tell ."
neutral,"No , not usually . Most people are married in a church , and then the wedding party and guests go to another place for the reception . Sometimes , however , they hold the reception in a big room in the church ."
neutral,Where do they go ?
neutral,They go to the home of the bride ?
neutral,Maybe I'll be the one .
neutral,Is there any ticket left for tonight's concert ?
neutral,That's fine . I want 2 tickets .
neutral,It's once in blue moon .
neutral,Sure . How do you like your seats ?
neutral,I think they are too far from the stage . I want two in row 6 .
neutral,"No , the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them . But not too much . As the space between galaxies expands , it carries the galaxies further apart - like raisins in an expanding dough ."
neutral,Two people chat on the Net and step by step fall into love ! It's Net Love .
neutral,I watched the screen display !
neutral,"Sorry , I have no photo in my computer . And I have no scanner . I will show you later ."
neutral,"Yes , I had a bf before ."
neutral,"Besides the growth of these matchmaker sites , do you have any stats on success rates ? Are people out there finding true and lasting love through the Internet"
neutral,"Well , for a site like ecrush.com , since their debut in Valentine's Day in 1999 , of the 1.5 million people who have joined ecrush.com , 300000 have actually matched ."
neutral,Where do your parents live ?
neutral,I think you've lost it .
neutral,"Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ?"
neutral,"I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late ."
neutral,"Oh , what happened , Carole ?"
neutral,"We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . And if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station ."
neutral,What docking station ?
neutral,If the weather's fine .
neutral,Have you heard that Mel Gibson was arrested by the police last week ?
neutral,"I am confused . How could a golfer need so many clubs ? Seems to me , 14 altogether , right"
neutral,This is not to say you have to carry all of these clubs . It depends on your preferences .
neutral,Have you heard of Tiger Woods ?
neutral,Of course even people who don't know anything about golf know his name .
neutral,I live at No . 50 Xingu Street .
neutral,Who supports the family ?
neutral,"Very few , unfortunately ."
neutral,Where are you going ?
neutral,We're going to visit my sister in the city .
neutral,"Yes , she's lived there for about ten years ."
neutral,I remember when she moved there . Apartments were a lot cheaper then .
neutral,I know what you mean . It's hard to find anything that's reasonable now .
neutral,Bring them to my wife's car .
neutral,"Yes , that's true , but my wife found a new apartment on the Internet the other day and she wants to move right away ."
neutral,My name is Sam .
neutral,You are quite busy every day .
neutral,A necklace ?
neutral,I have no idea .
neutral,Open it now .
neutral,I didn't know that . I thought that you were happy together .
neutral,"That isn't true . Actually , we have been separated for six months ."
neutral,"That isn't true . Actually , we have been separated for six months ."
neutral,Why don't you walk ? It's only about 20 minutes walking and it's a nice evening .
neutral,"Nowadays , ships and boats are no longer so important in transportation as they used to be ."
neutral,"The pace of life of people is now getting faster and faster , so the speed of ships and boats seems to be so slow . I think it may be the reason why people don't like to travel by boat ."
neutral,But the most of the transoceanic cargo transportation is still carried by boat .
neutral,"yeah , it ’ s fair to say so ."
neutral,Why not ? They are very fun and exiting .
neutral,"About David ? No , I didn ’ t hear anything ."
neutral,"Well , I heard David has been fired ."
neutral,"Thanks , but I'm a lousy typist ."
neutral,It is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . What do you think ? Do you want to quit your job ?
neutral,No . Not now . I think I'll try to keep this one .
neutral,"I Know . And you should be more careful , too ."
neutral,Don ’ t count on it . I think the best way to prevent AIDS is to keep yourself clean by having clean sex and keeping a regular sex partner .
neutral,Do you mean the ' I love you ' virus that attacks computers through e-mail ?
neutral,But we need the wood .
neutral,How do you celebrate Thanksgiving in the US ?
neutral,"You know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . They may insist they are sick when they are not ."
neutral,"Hi , Mrs . Henderson ."
neutral,Of course I have plenty of time . What's new ?
neutral,How much is it for each square meter ? How large is the apartment ?
neutral,"It's 7500 yuan per square meter , and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . Its total area is about 80 square meters ."
neutral,That surely will cost you a lot of money . Are you going to make a full payment ?
neutral,Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .
neutral,It's possible .
neutral,The idea about Friday the Thirteenth is totally ridiculous . I don't believe it at all .
neutral,"Oh , did you get a job ?"
neutral,When do children start school in your country ?
neutral,"Normally at six . Before that , they spend several years in the kindergarten or pre-school education center ."
neutral,"But thats only in the cities , isnt it ?"
neutral,Let me see . How much should I pay for you ?
neutral,"Jim and you are bosom friends , aren't you ?"
neutral,What do you mean ?
neutral,"Well , I thought he was , but he ends up to be a con man ."
neutral,I know that they are auspicious fish . It's quite popular nowadays .
neutral,"OK , I understand , but what else could we do ?"
neutral,"May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ?"
neutral,I wonder how old these things are . Thousands of years ?
neutral,"You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now ."
neutral,Are you ? What are you busy with ?
neutral,"Oh , lots of things . Mostly training new people ."
neutral,It must be hard being a father .
neutral,My husband is betting on France .
neutral,"Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something ."
neutral,What's that ?
neutral,"Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ?"
neutral,"The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening ."
neutral,Another terror film ? There is too much terror and violence in the films . Do you like seeing such a picture ?
neutral,"I don't really like seeing bloody frames , but I appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects ."
neutral,"Yes , but I couldn't help it . I was late getting off work for a start , and then I missed the bus . The bus I did catch got caught in a traffic jam . It was one thing after another ."
neutral,"Yes , but there's a rush on at the moment , and my boss asked me to do some urgent letters ."
neutral,"Well , no . I thought I'd finish in about five minutes , and I didn't want to be difficult about just a few minutes . If it hadn't been for missing the bus and the traffic , I wouldn't have been so late . I'm sorry ."
neutral,You'll have to get it fixed .
neutral,When will the lecture begin ?
neutral,"Well , I must be off now . I have an appointment at six ."
neutral,See you later .
neutral,You've plenty of time yet . The railway station is very close . It won't take more than twenty minutes to get there .
neutral,Call us as soon as you get home .
neutral,Yes . Both have sent back pictures of the planet . And the latter did a better job .
neutral,"Well then , what are your spoils ?"
neutral,OK . Do you have the receipt with you ? I think they will ask you to show them the receipt first .
neutral,I see . Overdoing it will do more harm than good .
neutral,Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying .
neutral,"But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started . Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip !"
neutral,"You went out on a date last night , didn't you ?"
neutral,"I did phone her this morning , but she hung up on me . I think she is going to walk out on me ."
neutral,Do you know who Ammo Hung is ?
neutral,I have no idea . Tell me .
neutral,What does he do there ?
neutral,Indeed you know much about him .
neutral,"Look at this , A Brief Introduction of Hollywood ."
neutral,"Now that you'recommending such enormous fees , producers , directors , movie-makers must see you in a completely different light ."
neutral,A magic love potion ?
neutral,Have you fallen in love ?
neutral,Did you watch the Premiership last night ?
neutral,"Haha . That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent . And the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . Such games are quite pleasing to the eye ."
neutral,I wish it could be Germany . But it seems they are not in a very good conditions .
neutral,"I agree . Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well-timed passes ."
neutral,"Yes . They have a good reputation for their tenacity and discipline , especially in vital , decisive encounters ."
neutral,What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ?
neutral,Maybe it can take effect .
neutral,Are you a smoker ?
neutral,I had my first cigarette when I was seventeen .
neutral,Where ?
neutral,No.You can't suddenly make smoking illegal . But the government could prohibit smoking in public places like cinemas and theaters .
neutral,"Well , she is thinking of doing some household cleaning or baby sitting in the community ."
neutral,Well ...
neutral,Can you lend me fifty bucks ?
neutral,I'm not disciplined enough I guess .
neutral,In a few months I'm planning to invest my money into some foreign companies . I think you need to reevaluate your spending habits .
neutral,You must have been really hurting for cash to have done that .
neutral,"What , curly ?"
neutral,"No , not at all . Very straight . Her hair comes down like this ... just over the ears ."
neutral,It seems quite normal to me . It is pretty much what I want to do .
neutral,We're catching most of our fish with lures .
neutral,What kind of live bait are you using ? Worms or minnows ?
neutral,Are you having any luck with the worms ?
neutral,"I would , but I don't have any in my tackle box ."
neutral,I'm just fishing from the shore . How about you ?
neutral,We went out in our boat . I have a favorite fishing hole out there .
neutral,Sweet.Can you tell me where it is ?
neutral,Do you think that's a good spot ?
neutral,"Yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . As a man of medium height in the West , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout ."
neutral,It seems to be . How about you today ?
neutral,"Millions of amateur investors like you , have to rely on a dizzying array of financial newspapers , magazines and commentators to get investment information ."
neutral,Yes.It ' s sometimes scary if you think of the tremendous amount of media we face every day .
neutral,Which financial magazines and newspapers do you think do the best job of checking facts ?
neutral,"Well , for example , The Wall Street Journal is very , very good . Even though it's used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by Ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin ."
neutral,What kinds of books do you like to read ?
neutral,"By the way , would you like to see movies ?"
neutral,What do you do in your spare time ?
neutral,"I like to play golf , play badminton or crack jokes ."
neutral,"If they are just like us , they are not middle-aged ."
neutral,"Oh , you know , we are not middle-aged . You're old , and I'm aging ."
neutral,Have you got the ticket ?
neutral,"Yes , I did ."
neutral,At 11:00 o'clock .
neutral,What depends ?
neutral,"Oh , I see ."
neutral,"No , I live alone in a flat near my work place ."
neutral,Do you often go back to see your parents .
neutral,"Good afternoon , sir . May I help you ?"
neutral,I'd like to reserve a table for three at 6:30 this evening .
neutral,"Let me check . Hold on , please ... Yes , that's fine . Smoking or nonsmoking area ?"
neutral,"How do you spell it , sir ?"
neutral,Heavy metal music is a lot different from rap music.You can dance to heavy metal .
neutral,"Hello , Friendship Restaurant . May I help you ?"
neutral,Eight .
neutral,Do you want an expensive meal ?
neutral,Forty to eighty RIB Yuan a plate .
neutral,Six o'clock in the afternoon .
neutral,"That , My Heart Will Go On . It warms my heart . you know , JanetJackson , Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different ."
neutral,Why ?
neutral,I guess it could happen .
neutral,I would say it was a typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood thriller .
neutral,Read it yourself and find out !
neutral,I know you are a good dancer . What dances do you like ?
neutral,"I think so , because most young people like modern dances , such as rock and roll ."
neutral,"And a typical example has been the Chinese athletes at the Beijing Olympics , right ?"
neutral,"Well , it costs an arm and a leg — 30 yuan per person . What a costly sport ! That is why I have to refrain from even thinking about it . And I find jogging a very agreeable substitute ."
neutral,"Well , what's the climate like in your country ?"
neutral,I like spring . The days are long and the night are short . The flowers are in bloom.We go on picnics .

neutral,How do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one ?
neutral,"At the beginning , it does not matter , but once someone gets one ball in , it is set ."
neutral,Certainly . What's the matter ?
neutral,Really . I'll get a computer at once .
neutral,"Right . With the establishment of Internet and a lot of web companies , people are getting more and more dependent on the web ."
neutral,One of the common uses of PC is that people can buy goods through it without going out to the physical stores .
neutral,All my relatives are getting together at my house .
neutral,That's great . M OST of my family is coming home too .
neutral,I asked Santa to bring me a new sweater and some computer games .
neutral,I guess using a computer has a great deal to do with human interaction . Getting in touch with each other must be more fun to your wife and my son than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
neutral,Don't you think it's a sheer waste of both time and money ?
neutral,Yes .
neutral,BBS means Bulletin Board Service .
neutral,"I need your help , Bob ."

neutral,What were the results of the game ?
neutral,What was the actual score ?
neutral,What happened ?
neutral,When do the playoffs start ?
neutral,"Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?"
neutral,I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .
neutral,What happened ? Why didn't he win ?
neutral,"I suppose you're right . They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around ."
neutral,Tell me all about it .
neutral,What note ?
neutral,"Speaking . Who's calling , please ?"
neutral,"Hi , Mary . This is Tom ."
neutral,But she wants to learn the butterfly stroke
neutral,That's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great .
neutral,"Quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ?"
neutral,What did you do ?
neutral,What should I do then ?
neutral,"Oh , I'm afraid I can't . I've had a date already ."
neutral,Maybe some other time .
neutral,We're having some friends over.What are you doing ?
neutral,Not much .
neutral,No . I heard that's really boring .
neutral,' Round ' and ' frame ' are two different terms .
neutral,"I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready ."
neutral,Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ?
neutral,"I was born on April 15 , 1986 ."
neutral,I want to do everything I can .
neutral,There are clubs for beginners . It's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times .
neutral,What kinds of clubs ?
neutral,"My native place is Shanghai , which is a very beautiful cosmopolitan city ."

neutral,I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball .
neutral,Do you like watching football matches ?
neutral,What was the score ?
neutral,"Yes , I've just come back from Scotland ."
neutral,Isn't there any coach to teach you how to ski ?
neutral,Of course there is . The top-level coaches there are from the State Sports General Administration .
neutral,"How do you like skiing , Pat ?"
neutral,"No , quite the opposite . I thought I'd never stop falling down . Then all of a sudden I started skiing much better ."
neutral,"I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-depth research before I send my application letters out ."
neutral,I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm .
neutral,"Are you free this weekend , Miss Rose ?"
neutral,"Yes , I am . What's up ?"
neutral,"To tell you the truth , I don't like it . It's too noisy ."
neutral,I hope he can come later .
neutral,How do we get to the library from here ?
neutral,"It's straight down this road on the left , next to the museum . It takes about 10 minutes ."
neutral,I went on a trip with my family last week .
neutral,"London , Paris and a few other cities ."
neutral,And do you really love her ?
neutral,You'd better leave her alone .
neutral,Can you tell me the time ? I've got an appointment at 8: 30 .
neutral,"By the way , could you tell me what day it is today ?"
neutral,"And the date , please ."
neutral,What time do you have ?
neutral,A quarter past five .
neutral,See you .
neutral,That ’ s enough for you to worship the ground she treats on .
neutral,I see . Would you like me to reschedule you for another night ?

neutral,Next Wednesday .
neutral,Ten days ago .
neutral,"Well , about an hour or so ."
neutral,Are you free this Saturday evening ?
neutral,"Wow , is that your sports car ?"
neutral,"Yes , do you like it ?"
neutral,The brakes don't really work that well anymore either .
neutral,Why don't you get it all fixed ?
neutral,"Annie , what is troubling you ? You look unhappy ."
neutral,"Much as we'd like to , but we've booked up already for that time ."
neutral,"Ye Ting , who are these people in the picture ?"
neutral,"Don ’ t say things like this . Please be confident . I think you still have the chance to win her love , unless you don ’ t love her anymore ."
neutral,Don ’ t you think she is a bit out of my way ?
neutral,Do you live with your parents ?
neutral,How often do you go back to visit them ?
neutral,"Bill , do you know if the cafeteria around the corner's open today ?"
neutral,"Sorry , I can't . I have to work late at the laboratory ."
neutral,"I have no idea , any suggestions ?"
neutral,Has Robert ever missed coming to one of our parties ?
neutral,But how can I prevent a deficit ?
neutral,Sort of yes .
neutral,Nothing but the best from my dad . I like everything about it except for the brakes . They are a bit sticky .
neutral,It's possible . Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go .
neutral,I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .
neutral,"Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it ."
neutral,"I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music ."
neutral,"Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy ."
neutral,"You need a child first , and that's your duty , too ."
neutral,How are you ?
neutral,Good . Do you speak English ?
neutral,My name is Jessica . What's yours ?
neutral,John .
neutral,What did you say ?
neutral,I said it's 5:10 PM .
neutral,"Fine , how are you doing ?"
neutral,I'd like to go to an Italian restaurant .
neutral,"It's Thursday , I think ."
neutral,We'll meet again in a few days .
neutral,That ’ s an exception . But I am fed up with those who keep a straight face in front of me .
neutral,"I cannot see eye to eye with you here . You see , I am fed up with those who keep smiling to me . I mean , they smile for no reason at all ."
neutral,"That means you don ’ t like them . If you hit it off with them , you will like to see their smiles ."
neutral,"Charlotte , have you had your supper ?"
neutral,You must not feel depressed about such a trivial thing .
neutral,Really ? I hope to meet him soon .
neutral,"Ah , you're just too emotional ."
neutral,I haven't seen Bill lately . How is he ?
neutral,Yeah ! He is a nice guy . He is very helpful and always bends over backward to help those who are in need of help .
neutral,But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .
neutral,I usually play with my schoolmates .
neutral,Do you like watching football matches ?
neutral,Is 11:30 AM OK ?
neutral,No . But I ’ m sure she is a good girl . My sixth sense tells me so .
neutral,"As a matter of fact , he hasn't been feeling too well ."
neutral,"Ah , you changed so fast ."
neutral,He's a little sick under the weather .
neutral,He has the flu .
neutral,Tell him I was asking about him .

neutral,"Hi , Nice to meet you ."
neutral,Nice to meet you too .
neutral,I'm a doctor .
neutral,Oh . Where do you work ?
neutral,At a high school in New Jersey .
neutral,"I'm sorry , but I can't find the book you lent me . I guess I have lost it ."
neutral,I really don't think this weather will last .
neutral,How's the weather today ?
neutral,I think that's too late .
neutral,Is 6:00 PM OK ?
neutral,"Oh , I don't like that Restaurant . I don't want to go there ."
neutral,"You forgot all about it , didn't you ?"
neutral,"Well , it won't last long ."
neutral,What is today ?
neutral,Thursday .
neutral,"Yeah . I bet you did forget everything . What's the date today , do you know ?"
neutral,Is your watch right ?
neutral,Yes . There's only a few seconds in a whole month .

neutral,Who's that man standing next to her ?
neutral,"Yes , he's married ."
neutral,It says a storm may come tomorrow .
neutral,Yes . I have to drive to Washington D . C .
neutral,I really feel great shame . Let me buy a new one for you .
neutral,"Of course I did . I dreamed to be a pilot when I grow up . But unfortunately , I didn ’ t realize it ."
neutral,"I feel terrible , but I've just broken your ashtray ."
neutral,Really ? How long have you been playing the violin ?
neutral,"Very seldom , because tea has tannin which may be harmful to one's health ."
neutral,What good is it for ?
neutral,Have you been to California before ?
neutral,Yes . I went there once on a business trip .
neutral,Yes .
neutral,About 50 dollars .
neutral,"OK , can I bring a date with me ?"
neutral,Not that I know of . Why do you ask ?
neutral,You seem to be very tired .
neutral,We seem to be lost here .
neutral,I suggest that we go and ask for help from the policeman .
neutral,"Yeah , we have to do something to help the people in the stricken area ."
neutral,I think you're right . An international response to this problem is needed .
neutral,"What , it keeps coming back ?"
neutral,It's too complicated . I'll just stick to the plain clothes .
neutral,"No , I only know four great beauties of China ."
neutral,Yeah ? Were they famous because of the ugliness ?
neutral,"Though they were ugly , they had great virtue ."
neutral,"Mo Mu , Thong Lichen , Meng Gang and Ran Nv . They were well respected ."
neutral,"Jeff , I'm going to the supermarket . Do you want to come with me ?"
neutral,"Don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . It opens at 8: 00 ."
neutral,She lives in San Francisco .
neutral,I think she's lived there for about 10 years .
neutral,That's a long time . Where did she live before that ?
neutral,San Diego .
neutral,Go easy . Overwork is bad for your health .
neutral,What does Stephanie study ?
neutral,I trust you .
neutral,Do you like tea ?
neutral,"Yeah , but scented tea is now in fashion ."
neutral,"Yes , why ?"
neutral,Nothing . I'm just asking .
neutral,For example ?
neutral,"Well , ping-pong is our national sport , and we just have to keep winning one honor after another . That's why many people think such rules acceptable . After all , they are funded out of taxpayers'money ."
neutral,"Sarah , what did you do today ?"
neutral,Did you buy anything ?
neutral,Fine .
neutral,"Are you serious , John ?"
neutral,"Can we sit on the grass , darling ?"
neutral,What does the notice say ?
neutral,How about your mother ?

neutral,"True , a sea food restaurant ."
neutral,He said he will get married by the end of this month .
neutral,"Big talk , I ’ d say . He does not have a girlfriend yet ."
neutral,You need to take some breaks throughout the day . Studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective .
neutral,"Hello , Tom !"
neutral,I'm just a little tired .
neutral,I have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
neutral,So what did you do ?
neutral,The man behind your mother must be your elder brother .
neutral,"Yes , he was 29 then ."
neutral,Then do you think that life is arranged by something above us .
neutral,"Maybe , the whirligig of time , who knows ?"
neutral,"That's right . And his wife is a baby doll , too . She used to have many followers ."
neutral,"Jacob , are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine ?"
neutral,"She's fairly tall , maybe 2 inches taller than me ."
neutral,Is she chubby ?
neutral,"No , but she does wear contact lenses ."
neutral,What's her personality like ?
neutral,So there is something wrong with her ! It was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true !
neutral,How can I ? They're as alike as two peas in a pod .

neutral,Do you know what E-commerce is ?
neutral,"Sure , but you must have access to the Internet ."

neutral,"Graham , why are you always on the phone with Jane ?"
neutral,Are you sure ?
neutral,How are you ?
neutral,That's great . When are you starting ?
neutral,No I'm afraid not . I'm meeting Ruth then . How about the fourteenth in the morning ?
neutral,No . I'm busy then too . I'm meeting Dorothy Heath at North Bridge Road . Are you free on Thursday afternoon ?
neutral,Yeah . Earthquake is one of the most badly natural disasters in the world .
neutral,"Yeah , I got home around two ."
neutral,"Hey , what's the matter ?"
neutral,Can I use your laptop for a while ?

neutral,"No , we're not . We've been drifting apart for a while ."
neutral,I went to a movie with my boyfriend .
neutral,"Oh , yeah ? What's it about ?"
neutral,The ending is a bit of a surprise . I don't want to ruin it for you .
neutral,Did Roll win the race ?
neutral,"You really have a big head , don't you ."
neutral,I've got to go to bed . Have to work tomorrow .
neutral,"Song , I hate to say goodbye , but I have to ."
neutral,I would like to rent a car . What kind of car do you have ?
neutral,What is the rate ?
neutral,There is no charge for mileage . And fill up the gas when you return the car to us as it is not included .
neutral,My mother is a professor and my father is a manager .
neutral,"This is my uncle , Charles ."
neutral,What shall I call him ?
neutral,"Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry ."
neutral,I heard many stories about your brother .
neutral,Sorry to interrupt . Can I have a word with you ?
neutral,What a pity ! The party is very interesting .
neutral,I don ’ t like to go to the movies on a date . It's noisy there .
neutral,"Hi , where have you been ?"
neutral,I had to visit all my relatives .
neutral,"Zach , what's that on your arm ?"
neutral,"We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse ."
neutral,Autumn . Autumn is the best season in Beijing .
neutral,That's the one .
neutral,Did he know that his grandfather was so wealthy ?
neutral,What's that ?
neutral,You can say that again .
neutral,"Um , very nice . It's warm in spring and cool in autumn ."
neutral,There's been bad blood between them since Bobbie took away John's girlfriend .
neutral,Some people pile on their agonise and try to seek other ’ s sympathy by telling them how miserable they are .
neutral,I was fooled once . A lady told me she needed some money to keep the pot boiling . So I gave her some money and bailed her out of the situation . But later I learned that she had lied to me .
neutral,You are still wet behind the ears . You should have seen through her .
neutral,Nothing rang a bell .
neutral,"Sometimes you look like brains , and sometimes you are simple a Barbie Doll ."
neutral,I don ’ t know whether I am a Barbie Doll or you are one .
neutral,"I know , I know . But you always bat around without doing things useful ."
neutral,All right . Do what you can do now instead of twiddling your thumbs .
neutral,It's August the thirteenth .
neutral,How many people are there in your family ?
neutral,"My immediate family is quite small . It ’ s just my older step-brother , my mom , my step-dad and me . how about you ?"
neutral,"I have a large family . I have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and parents ."
neutral,"Interesting . It must be great having a twin sister . Are you best friends , too ?"
neutral,What about your step-brother ’ s mother ? Does he keep in touch with her ?
neutral,"That ’ s true . But as a woman , I ’ m glad that even though I don ’ t want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can ’ t imagine what China would be like if there weren ’ t a one-child policy !"
neutral,"The small one , just down the street . I like their generic brand ."
neutral,I have been using the store across town for years .
neutral,"Well , I ’ m not really a spring chicken anymore . We don ’ t know what will happen ."
neutral,"How are you doing , Andrew ?"
neutral,Not at all .
neutral,Did your husband's family get to meet your family ?
neutral,"You really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ?"
neutral,"No , you are wrong . Money can't buy happiness and health . I won't sacrifice my health in order to get money . In other words , I don't want to be a millionaire and I want to have more free time to enjoy life ."
neutral,What type do you like the best ?
neutral,I see . I generally like movies to help calm me down . I think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it .
neutral,Like what ?
neutral,Is the house pretty run-down .
neutral,"Yeah , it's very easy . But it's above Nick's head"
neutral,He's always confused by easy questions .
neutral,"I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ?"
neutral,"No , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years ago would be a great way to feed my imagination even more !"
neutral,"Right , to be famous to be respectable in some way ."
neutral,"Oh , thank you . Your skirt looks beautiful , too ."
neutral,"Hello , Tom ! Do you have plans for this evening ?"
neutral,"That ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing I can do about that . My boss won ’ t believe me if I tell him the truth ."
neutral,Next month . So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year .
neutral,Do you play table tennis ?
neutral,Basketball and swimming .
neutral,Good morning !
neutral,"I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have any nightmares !"
neutral,"I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something ."
neutral,What's the way you keep in contact ?
neutral,What kind of music do you like ?
neutral,I think I like classical music better .
neutral,But many roads are very narrow .
neutral,"Yes , because of fewer people ."
neutral,Hi . My name is Jessica .
neutral,Nice to meet you .
neutral,That means it's developing very fast .
neutral,You said it .
neutral,Problems are inevitable .
neutral,Not really . I just worked on my car all day .
neutral,I live in an apartment downtown .
neutral,"No , not much . In fact , nothing ever really happens . That's the trouble ."
neutral,There must be something weighing on your mind . What is it ?
neutral,"Dad , I lost mum's necklace . I'm afraid she will scold me ."
neutral,"Were you born in the U . S . , Melissa ?"
neutral,Yeah . We went to a movie last Saturday . We saw Police Partners II .
neutral,Did you like it ?

neutral,I can't understand him anyway .
neutral,I wish I were just as handsome .
neutral,You are !
neutral,"Yes , she's a professional climber ."
neutral,Would you ask him to tell us more about the country ?
neutral,He loves that blonde girl .
neutral,"Yes , he once gave her seven roses ."
neutral,I'm dreadfully sorry for you .
neutral,Is there any clue ?
neutral,He must be an experienced accountant .
neutral,He has to deliver letters every day .
neutral,"Yeah , I'm very worried about his health ."
neutral,"No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ?"
neutral,I thought you wanted to know more about her .
neutral,Do you know what they are playing ?
neutral,They're doing a seventeenth-century program .
neutral,"Well , I'm not sure of his name , but I know it's going to be his farewell performance ."
neutral,"Oh , he's a very serious person ."
neutral,Have you heard we'll have a pay rise ?
neutral,"Judge from his look , he's a very serious person ."
neutral,He's very strict with us .
neutral,And I hear he gives very good lectures .
neutral,"Oh , yeah . The total amount is no less than 13,000 RIB , according to our itinerary ."
neutral,"In that case , we can choose the Youth Hotel . It's a good choice , clean and economic ."
neutral,What kind of movie is it ?
neutral,"I'm afraid I know less than you do.Tell me more about her , will you ?"
neutral,"Well , I like others very much , but I really don't think much of this one ."
neutral,Whose part do you think is best played ?
neutral,But it went by fast . It was interesting .
neutral,Of course .
neutral,I think about twenty-five .
neutral,I feel sorry for you .
neutral,Yes .
neutral,No . That's incomplete .
neutral,Yelling doesn't do any good .
neutral,I heard the film was after the novel The Godfather .
neutral,I don't know . I just woke up .
neutral,Why do you say that ?
neutral,No .
neutral,Don't you ever cheat on me .
neutral,"I will chop your toes off , one by one ."
neutral,You bet it .
neutral,"Hi , Charles . What's the matter ?"
neutral,"She's not good at remembering things . We have a date , and she's an hour late ! !"
neutral,"Oh , right . My geography isn't very good !"
neutral,It's not even noon yet .
neutral,Turn on the air conditioner .
neutral,It doesn't work .
neutral,I don't know .
neutral,"Hi , Nicole . Did you have a good weekend ?"
neutral,"Yes , I did . But I feel tired today ."
neutral,"Well , on Saturday I cleaned the house and played tennis . Then on Sunday I hiked in the country ."
neutral,"And I bet you studied , too ."
neutral,Sort of . I played golf on my computer !
neutral,"Oh , really ? What do you do there ?"
neutral,Oh ? Where do you work ?
neutral,"Do you like jazz , Tom ?"
neutral,"Well , my sister is a lawyer ."
neutral,"Yes , she does . But she's working in Washington , D . C . , right now . Her job is top secret ."
neutral,"Uh , I'd like to , but I have to work late ."
neutral,"Diana , in your opinion , which is more important , IQ or EQ ?"
neutral,Is it the same in Korea ?
neutral,"I don't think so . In Korea some marriages break up , but most couples stay together ."
neutral,Do people get married young ?
neutral,They sure are .
neutral,Did they catch him ?
neutral,Did the cops find out why he flew into the U . S . ?
neutral,His life sucked . He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down .
neutral,And when did you come to Los Angeles ?
neutral,Drama . I was an actor for five years after college .
neutral,"No , I'm not . What are you planning to do ?"
neutral,"Sure , I'd love to ! But let me pay for the tickets this time . It's my turn ."
neutral,I wanted to go to Malibu beach .
neutral,I like Santa Monica .
neutral,He always likes to say something as if all his geese are swans .
neutral,I know this characteristic of him . So I never think seriously of his words .
neutral,You like to communicate with him ?
neutral,"Excuse me , I'd like to ask you a few questions about the city ."
neutral,We should keep Frank at arm's length .
neutral,Now I know why I split up with Mike . We found we were simply not good for each other .
neutral,Is that so ? I'm afraid it is too narrow-minded to judge people using astrology . It's all stereotypes !
neutral,Temple fair ?
neutral,I hear that you are in love with Mike .
neutral,What is that below ?
neutral,How is Tom now ?
neutral,He's out of the hospital and up and about again at last .
neutral,Yes .
neutral,The poor girl is up to the eyes in study all the day .
neutral,"Yeah , she has a lot of homework ."
neutral,Our eyes should look into the future . We could not live in the past .
neutral,You mean Lily's boyfriend ?
neutral,We'd better have a heart-to-heart talk with him .
neutral,Maybe I should go and ask him whether it's true .
neutral,"If he promised to help you , I'm sure he will help . He's a man of his word ."
neutral,You said it . I always count on him when I need his help .
neutral,"Me , too . I think he ’ s really a shoulder to cry on ."
neutral,Jane's mother always wants her to marry a big shot . J
neutral,I see . OK .
neutral,Because everyone is trying to butter him up .
neutral,"For example , the message for the day before yesterday notified me that I , as a Leo guy , was to have some "" unusual experience in food and drink . And as it turned out , the reality matched this prediction well . Lasi night , I was treated to a dinner party by Mr . Lee ."
neutral,"For fun . It serves as a shared topic to them.While they claim to consult the predictions constantly and marvel at their "" accuracy ' . they do not necessarily take them seriously . When it that these predictions are matched by their real-life experiences , they delight in spreading the thrill with friends . But if there isn't any correlation between reality and predictions , they just grin , forget about them , and go on living as usual ."
neutral,Are you going to the party on Saturday ?
neutral,"It's very hot , the temperature is often over 40 ° C ."
neutral,Why ?
neutral,"Yes , it is.But it's nice in spring and fall ."
neutral,How long has it been since we last saw each other ?
neutral,What have you been doing for the past two years ?
neutral,Sure .
neutral,Let's stop and have a look .
neutral,Don't waste time .
neutral,Why ?
neutral,But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
neutral,On 20th May 1963 .
neutral,Is a shop there ?
neutral,It's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land . Everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach .
neutral,"That is to say , you like all genres except for horror movies ."
neutral,"Oh , I make a phone call once a month ."
neutral,"Now you don't have the butterflies in your stomach , do you ?"
neutral,"I cannot dance , you know . I have't such a talent ."
neutral,It sounds that you have a high opinion of him .
neutral,I told you that she is no fool .
neutral,Let ’ s have a try .
neutral,It's Ellie and her friends .
neutral,"Oh , yes.Ellie was playing games all day yesterday.By the way , Alice , when's your birthday ?"
neutral,I have an idea .
neutral,What is it ?
neutral,"Yes , I can , but not very well ."
neutral,Where did you learn it ?
neutral,At school . And I'm still learning it now .
neutral,"Well , last night I had a big argument with Ann ."
neutral,Sometimes I forget that we don't have school on Saturdays .
neutral,Okay .
neutral,It's Lin . It's spelled L-I-N .
neutral,Did you hear that Mary ’ s marriage is on the rocks ?
neutral,"Yesterday I met Mary , and she told me her husband often made pass at his secretary ."
neutral,Guess what ? Paul and Susan are engaged .
neutral,A week ago ? They met last summer and now just sink . They will be married soon .
neutral,"Mary , you're going to have to work on your pronunciation ."
neutral,Of course . You didn't have to ask me .
neutral,But I still have to tell her .
neutral,"Hi Wei , what are you going to do this weekend ?"
neutral,Oh right ... How about Sunday ?
neutral,"Ah , I ’ m going to the pub to watch the football ."
neutral,Why so late ? Didn ’ t she want to get married this October ?
neutral,"Yeah , I did . But my fiancee has an important project ."
neutral,"That ’ s really a shame . By the way , who will be the bridesmaid ?"
neutral,What ?
neutral,"You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering ."
neutral,What's there after that ?
neutral,"Well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world ."
neutral,"Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places ."
neutral,What university would you enter ?
neutral,Did you ? And what course did you take there ?
neutral,"Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A ."
neutral,"Yes , that's right ."
neutral,A good suggestion for you.You need a holiday .
neutral,"Certainly , perhaps ."
neutral,It looks like there are a lot of people inside .
neutral,Yeah . I've invited a lot of friends besides you .
neutral,Is she American ?
neutral,Peter really is a remarkable expert ! There is very little he doesn ’ t know .
neutral,1:30 P . m . But I've got to check in at 12:30 P . m .
neutral,What airline and what flight ?
neutral,"Yeah , Bob moved in last week . He is a nice guy and so far everything is cool except this girlfriend ."
neutral,Oh ? What's wrong with his girlfriend ?
neutral,"Well , I guess it might take some time to get used to ."
neutral,"No , it's so much worse . And tonight they invited me out to dinner . I really have no idea how I'm going to pull it off ."
neutral,Yeah . He always tickled my finny bone with his college stories .
neutral,I am not good at picking gifts . Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ?
neutral,"Hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home ."
neutral,A plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to get through the customs ?
neutral,What happened ?
neutral,It was the police wo helped me to do that .
neutral,Did you get the car you wanted ?
neutral,"It is marvelous , and the price is marvelous , as well ."
neutral,"Oh , I must have been sitting in the same position too long . My legs have fallen asleep ."
neutral,That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways .
neutral,Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ?
neutral,You ’ d better give up smoking . It ’ s bad for your health .
neutral,You ’ re right . But you know it ’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking .
neutral,But you should make up your mind first .
neutral,You know I often have to work far into the night . I need smoking to keep me awake .
neutral,Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy .
neutral,"I see . Do you live in this neighborhood , too ?"
neutral,"Oh , Cindy did mention you before . You're Alexander Newman ."
neutral,Don't worry . We can call a cab . It'll be alright .
neutral,"Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening ."
neutral,"You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit ."
neutral,"You know , I often have to work till late at night . I need something to keep me awake ."
neutral,It seems you have to take time .
neutral,Exactly .
neutral,Who ?
neutral,"John Smith , the escaped criminal ."
neutral,I think I must report to the cops .
neutral,Why are you walking to and fro in the room ?
neutral,Don ’ t worry . They are grown-ups .
neutral,What happened to Nancy ? She is all sweetness and light today .
neutral,She is going to get married .
neutral,I don ’ t know .
neutral,Poor guy ! It will take him a long time to get back on his feet .
neutral,It ’ s still touch and go . We don ’ t see how she can make it .
neutral,She must be a good wife .
neutral,I didn ’ t mean to hurt anyone .
neutral,Isn ’ t London hot in the summer ?
neutral,Well it can be but Shanghai is much warmer than London .
neutral,I see . What about transport ? How does Shanghai compare to London ?
neutral,"Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ?"
neutral,Oh you look awful ! What ’ s the matter ?
neutral,"Yes , I think you ’ re right !"
neutral,What do your parents think of your dating a boy ?
neutral,"No , he has mended his way . After his father died , he set his hand to the job of putting his business affairs in order ."
neutral,Dinner ? Where ?
neutral,What kind of food do they serve ?
neutral,You mean you've never had a boyfriend ?
neutral,"Well . Yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first . Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think . Anyway , you're certainly not shy !"
neutral,"Yeah , I guess so ."
neutral,You should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise .
neutral,What's your favorite book ?
neutral,"If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition ."
neutral,Didn ’ t you sleep well last night ?
neutral,"I twisted and turned all night , and couldn ’ t sleep . I was worried about my mother ’ s health ."
neutral,Where are you going this weekend ?
neutral,I only watch now .
neutral,You can twist his arm in order to have a control of him .
neutral,Every country should face the history .
neutral,How can you be so sure ?
neutral,"He knows a lot about law and he ’ s eloquent , too ."
neutral,I washed my car instead .
neutral,Oh I didn ’ t go . I stayed at home with my family .
neutral,"I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ?"
neutral,"Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays ."
neutral,He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ?
neutral,"I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career ."
neutral,"In the same way , probably ."
neutral,How long have you been in England ?
neutral,"You are not English , are you ?"
neutral,"No , I don't think we have ."

neutral,"I want to see some of the famous places like Eiffel Tower , the Seine River ..."
neutral,What are you doing this weekend ?
neutral,Have you ever been to Britain ?
neutral,I ’ m afraid I ’ m busy tonight . I ’ m having dinner with friends .
neutral,"Actually , I haven ’ t been to the states but I have been to Canada ."
neutral,They are the Folk Antique Handicrafts and Collectibles Exhibition Halls .
neutral,It ’ s red and black .
neutral,Yeah . I think I can find it .
neutral,That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me .
neutral,Why ’ s that ?
neutral,I suppose so . We ’ re both friendly and easy-going .
neutral,Is she as clever as you ?
neutral,I'm taking two weeks now . but I want to save the other week and take it sometime during the winter .
neutral,Where are you going now .
neutral,Did you have a good journey ?
neutral,All these countries in two weeks ?
neutral,When is your birthday ?
neutral,"We sing "" Happy Birthday "" at the party and have birthday cakes ."
neutral,"Let me tell you the story.In 1892 , Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called ' Good Morning to you ' . But later someone added the words ' Happy Birthday ' to their tune ."
neutral,So the ' Happy Birthday ' song has been popular since then ?
neutral,I don't like Folk music very much .
neutral,I like classical music . Do you ?
neutral,I don't believe you .
neutral,It ’ s true .
neutral,That ’ s ok . Don ’ t be sorry . We ’ ll talk later .
neutral,The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors .
neutral,Please come in
neutral,"Morning , Mary . I haven't seen you in a long time . What's up ?"
neutral,So you don't travel a lot now ?
neutral,My sister was taken to the hospital yesterday
neutral,We'll have to hurry ; visiting hours will be over soon
neutral,OK . Let's go
neutral,What's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired .
neutral,"Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there ."
neutral,Jack and Mary broke up .
neutral,"Mary said Jack was cheating on her . Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . One day , May saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately ."
neutral,"No , I don ’ t think so . I know Mary . Once she makes a decision , she won ’ t change her mind ."
neutral,I see ! Do you want to ask her out ?
neutral,"Sure , but how ?"
neutral,Then you've got a lot of homework to do . You need to get her notice first .
neutral,But I always get tongue-tied when I see her .
neutral,That's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased .
neutral,I have thought about it for a while . I think it ’ s time to move on for both of us .
neutral,What ’ s your new job like ?
neutral,"What happened , John ?"
neutral,Why do you look unhappy ?
neutral,"You look pale , you must have poor health ."
neutral,Yeah . You said it .
neutral,Why not go to see the doctor ?
neutral,"Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ?"
neutral,"Well , it takes two to to make a happy marriage ."
neutral,She didn ’ t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ’ s hard work .
neutral,"I tell ya , when I got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . You've done a complete 180 ."
neutral,I know . But things have changed . I guess I've settled down .
neutral,I guess so .
neutral,It ’ s none of my business .
neutral,"Yeah , well , I fill you in one the details later ."
neutral,The woman was beaten again . Why didn ’ t she call the police .
neutral,You seem depressed these days . What's the matter ?
neutral,Where did you spend your holiday ?
neutral,It's Greek to me .
neutral,What ? It ’ s only 9p . m . Now . Why today he went to bed so early ?
neutral,I think that ’ s settled .
neutral,I can't deny that . She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight . I wish I knew more about her .
neutral,Of course I won't chill out . Opportunity knocks only once .
neutral,You're right . I will have a talk to her about that .
neutral,That is a deadly risky business . He should have it coming on him .
neutral,"She is as meek as a lamb . She never goes against anyone or anything . She's as good as gold , you know ?"
neutral,"He is tall and slim , fair-haired ."
neutral,Maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much !
neutral,"I was born in Beijing , but I spent most of my childhood in London ."
neutral,"I had a pretty strict upbringing , and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me ."
neutral,Did you know that you wanted to be a journalist right after your graduation ?
neutral,Let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...
neutral,"I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over ."
neutral,Waiting for someone .
neutral,Yes . He said I'm his dream girl .
neutral,I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated .
neutral,"Come on , nothing can be that bad ."
neutral,What is your idea ?
neutral,How did Jim get the money ?
neutral,He borrowed it from Nick .
neutral,Don't you know they've already broken up ?
neutral,"Yes , I watched once ."
neutral,What do you think of it ?
neutral,You mean Lily ’ s boyfriend ?
neutral,"Well , he is a hard case . Everyone would feel headache about him ."
neutral,"You are studying here , aren ’ t you ?"
neutral,Yes . I have been here for three years .
neutral,I'll accompany my wife to the hospital .
neutral,What's wrong with her .
neutral,"Hi , Shelley . Have you had lunch ?"
neutral,How come ?
neutral,"Henry married Rose only after her father's money , didn't he ?"
neutral,But he seems to be very happy with Rose .
neutral,He is more nice than wise .
neutral,Tom has grown six inches within a year .
neutral,I hope so .
neutral,"A :: Mr Clinton , it's nice to see you again ."
neutral,That's true . We can not judge people by appearance .
neutral,"You see , . This time I traveled to the West . When I looked out of the windows of the rain , all the lands that I could see are as dry as a bone ."
neutral,"I understand your feeling . When someone is feeling at loose ends , we may show mercy on him . This is what we call the "" milk of human kindness "" ."
neutral,"That's right . But feeling sorry for someone is one thing , and sticking to our principles is another . We must make a clear cut between them ."
neutral,The neighboring country is threatening their sovereignty with its nuclear bombs .
neutral,"Good afternoon , Johnson ."
neutral,For example ?
neutral,"We didn't pay attention to the environment , cut down trees and polluted the air ."
neutral,Yes I can . I speak it very well .
neutral,She married Jerrod .
neutral,How about a snack after work ?
neutral,Are you really interested in doing something ?
neutral,"Hi , dear , do you know what the important day is today ?"
neutral,"It ’ s Saturday , a great weekend ."
neutral,Do you know who ’ s just got married ? Old McDonald .
neutral,I ’ m here as a tourist .
neutral,"It ’ s a small world , isn ’ t it ?"
neutral,John got a heart attack last night .
neutral,"Not so good , though his nephew took him to hospital in time ."
neutral,I just had a terrible week .
neutral,I am sorry to hear that .
neutral,"Ho , no !"
neutral,Yeah . But I have an appointment with Ann .
neutral,"Yes , I Went there once last summer ."
neutral,Sandra is actually a blue chipper . I don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women .
neutral,"Hi , Jenny . Are still working ?"
neutral,"Um , which of them is the better typist ?"
neutral,"Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class ."
neutral,Is there anything wrong ?
neutral,You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision .
neutral,I really couldn't understand him .
neutral,"He is surely a hard nut , nobody likes approaching him ."
neutral,"Oh , I understand . She cooks , cleans and takes care of children . Is that right ?"
neutral,Then why are you wearing black shoes ?
neutral,"Because ... oh , all right . You win . Let ’ s pay for them and go ."
neutral,"Oh . So you think you can just do whatever you want , do you ?"
neutral,"Oh , I'm not sure I agree with you . It was not a good one , but it was not the worst one . Actually , it wasn't too bad ."
neutral,"If she has , they must be fair-weather friends ."
neutral,She'd better keep away from them .
neutral,I don't know . Maybe they're really crazy .
neutral,"No , they've got engaged ."
neutral,"Last weekend , while they were on their ski trip ."
neutral,Next June .
neutral,Maybe .
neutral,"Yes , that's right , around five nine five ten ."
neutral,Any marks on his face ?
neutral,What about his hair ?
neutral,"Straight , I think , and about average length"
neutral,"Boy , this sure doesn't help us much . It could be anybody . How about his cloth ? What was he wearing ?"
neutral,"Oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ?"
neutral,Not really . There are many successful mixed marriage around us .
neutral,So does my father . I'm already used to it .
neutral,"But I can't bear it , John ."
neutral,"Yeah , but he really puts blame on me ."
neutral,Who did the stupid thing ?
neutral,Maybe it was Dick .
neutral,I don't think so . Dick has been on the ball and he never does things like that .
neutral,Not particularly . I like a girl to be good .
neutral,"Yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children ."
neutral,Interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ?
neutral,"Yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old now and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot ."
neutral,Would you like to come out with me tonight ?
neutral,That sounds great .
neutral,I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know that .
neutral,What ’ s it for ?
neutral,Are you doing anything tonight ?
neutral,I decided to go for this kind of life .
neutral,Try to keep cool . It's not an easy take .
neutral,"No , I haven't had a chance to . But I have been watching a Chinese TV scries called "" Chinese-Style Divorce "" ."
neutral,"Oh , that's too short-lived ."
neutral,Not bad . Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband ?
neutral,Yes . They used to be joined at the hip .
neutral,Definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce .
neutral,You know that I care for you . I---I ’ m proud of you .
neutral,"Don ’ t cherish your words , dear ."
neutral,What's your opinion about childless couples ? Will you choose to have no kids ?
neutral,Why ? Do you have to make a choice now ?
neutral,Yes . It seems she can never accept a childless marriage . We had a fight last night .
neutral,"Don't worry . I think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together ."
neutral,I guess you're right . But I still prefer to have no child .
neutral,We are going to the concert this evening . Will you join us ?
neutral,"Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career ."
neutral,Which John ? Mr.Turnbow ’ s son ?
neutral,Yes . I ’ Ve read news about him in today ’ s paper .
neutral,"How ’ s your boy , Jack ?"
neutral,He was once a poor man but now he is a man of means .
neutral,Come on . Don ’ t hesitate .
neutral,You mean you suspect him .
neutral,I hope I can do something for you .
neutral,"You are interested in other people ’ s business , aren ’ t you ?"
neutral,Yes .
neutral,I cannot stay here any more minutes .
neutral,You can talk with him .
neutral,"Don't worry about it . It's not new , it already has a few scratches . Did you get hurt ?"
neutral,Forget about it .
neutral,"Maybe , but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well ."
neutral,"Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a tornado warning.So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere ."
neutral,I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone .
neutral,"Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ?"
neutral,"Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that ."
neutral,Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ?
neutral,"That bad , huh ?"
neutral,"Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too ."
neutral,"I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?"
neutral,"Oh , I'm so sorry to hear that . Have you seen a doctor or taken any medicines ?"
neutral,"Do you need anything , grocery ?"
neutral,I'd like both .
neutral,"In my wedding ceremony , where do my parents sit in the church ?"
neutral,So how long have you know Jack ?
neutral,"Well , he is , but he can be conniving at times ."
neutral,"Well , I think you should decide for yourself ."
neutral,"I did for a while , I suppose , until I left university , but after that not really ."
neutral,"Oh , of course ."
neutral,"No , not yet , but I do feel a little feverish ."
neutral,Only since this morning .
neutral,Hello ? Is that Mark ?
neutral,"Well , I'm not working on the weekend , so we could grab some beer , ice and our fishing rods , and head out to the river ."
neutral,Perhaps I'll agree with Mike . I couldn't stand a big wedding with many relatives and friends of my parents or my wife whom I'd never met before .
neutral,Did you enjoy it ?
neutral,So how long did you stay ?
neutral,Yeah ! May I introduce Mis ... eh ... Miss ...
neutral,My name is Jane Brown !
neutral,May I have your attention please ?
neutral,I heard Rose is pregnant . I hope it'll be a boy this time .
neutral,"After three baby girls in a row , Rose is under a lot of pressure from her in-laws.They want a boy in the worst way now ."
neutral,Hi ! This is Jill.How come you didn't come in today ?
neutral,"So , Paula , where are you from ?"
neutral,Let's see ... That was about six years ago .
neutral,I want to say goodbye to everyone .
neutral,I ’ m catching the nine fifteen train tomorrow morning .
neutral,But you just got here . Can ’ t you stay a little longer and have some tea ?
neutral,Nice to meet you .
neutral,"May I know your name , please ?"
neutral,"Yes , I was.You work for 3M , right ?"
neutral,Good .
neutral,May I know what you do ?
neutral,And how about Kyoto ?
neutral,Kyoto is lovely . It's full of beautiful old temples and gardens.It ' s a very historic city .
neutral,"I was in Tokyo in August , and it was really hot and humid . I went to Kyoto in October.It was hot and sunny , but there was no humidity ."
neutral,Yeah . I went to California to study .
neutral,I was there between 88 and 90 .
neutral,"So , what do you think ? How do you like New York ?"
neutral,"Ok , I won't keep you then ."
neutral,I really should be on my way .
neutral,"Oh , don ’ t go yet . Let ’ s at least have one more ."
neutral,It ’ s too bad that you have to leave so early .
neutral,Good morning Mike !
neutral,Morning Sally ! What's up ? you seem in a hurry !
neutral,This is it ?
neutral,"Oh , hi Pam . When did you get back from Canada ? How was it ?"
neutral,Montreal is more exciting . It has better shopping.The stores are cheaper and more interesting .
neutral,"Oh , Montreal of sure . It has more restaurants and clubs.They say Montreal is the most exciting city in Canada ."
neutral,"Hi Rose , what are you busy with right now ?"
neutral,I think he might . You'd better go to his office .
neutral,You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic .
neutral,"Yeah , I really wanted to come , too . But something unexpected in shanghai have come up . I have to fly out for a few days , but I'll be back soon ."
neutral,No problem.Call me when you get back .
neutral,"You'v been work here for nearly a month , how do you feel about the job ?"
neutral,"I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job ."
neutral,"That's right , I have to work hard ."
neutral,"A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ?"
neutral,Maybe next week .
neutral,Don ’ t you know they have had little affection for each other ?
neutral,"Oh , you are out of breath ! What ’ s happened ?"
neutral,A gang of bastards are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave this place the soonest .
neutral,Yes . In fact there are quite a large number of people who have no food to eat and no place to live in .
neutral,You can say that again . The government must open it ’ s eyes to the fact .
neutral,"Mrs . Smith , you are always worried about your children ."
neutral,"Hello . Could I speak to Justin , please ?"
neutral,Oh ... that's too bad .
neutral,She has keen to buy something which is much cheaper .
neutral,Maybe you are right .
neutral,What is the matter ?
neutral,My car run out of petrol .
neutral,Please go to see a doctor .
neutral,Don ’ t make a fuss . Many people divorce after having living together for many years .
neutral,No problem . I can deal with it well .
neutral,At least I ’ m the one who rates with her . I ’ m glad we can still be friends .
neutral,What is up ?
neutral,Look at the dishes ! I have told you three times to put away these dishes . But now ...
neutral,I have told you that I don ’ t need them any more . The thing that really annoys me is that you played dumb with me .
neutral,"She never puts words into her mouth , she only repeats the opinions of others ."
neutral,Maybe you can pick Mary ’ s brains now . She knows a lot about stocks .
neutral,But I put my foot down and insisted on her forgetting that .
neutral,I was not born yesterday . It must be either you or Adam .
neutral,Exactly . Herry is almost broken now .
neutral,Who do you think that has the motive ?
neutral,Is it serious ?
neutral,"Yeah . But in my heart of hearts , I find he ’ s not very much to my liking ."
neutral,"Oh , I know . She is a famous woman and a focus of the newspaper now because of this thing ."
neutral,I hear the school is very modern . It has the best equipments .
neutral,She said she would name it after her father .
neutral,Why do you say that ?
neutral,Susan has got married .
neutral,Her marriage was a hole and corner affair .
neutral,I am just thinking of it . Maybe I ’ ll go .
neutral,I don ’ t dare to look after the children now .
neutral,The children always make themselves in danger . I always have my heart in my mouth with them .
neutral,But the word is his brother would go bail for him . Last time it ’ s his father who went bail for him .
neutral,No . I don ’ t suppose he ’ s to blame . The man in the other car made a big mistake .
neutral,It seems that he has gone ape over the girl .
neutral,Why should I go against her ? She always seems to have better ideas .
neutral,Have you ever got the goods on her for wrong doings ?
neutral,"Well , it ’ s nice to have a husband like you ."
neutral,I want to give our kitchen the works .
neutral,No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It ’ s modern .
neutral,Let meet this right — — do you want to buy the house ?
neutral,It is very quiet and peaceful . This is what I want .
neutral,The government has to face a lot of social problems now .
neutral,You are right .
neutral,But he has suffered a lot .
neutral,We all know that . Her husband always make a fuss of her .
neutral,"Fortunately , things are changing these years ."
neutral,For what reason .
neutral,There are not so many people like you .
neutral,You are flattering me .
neutral,"Oh , he had fooled me ."
neutral,Maybe he is on the way home now .
neutral,Have you met John ?
neutral,It is time to butter him up .
neutral,I know . But my life seems super stressful . I really don ’ t know how to get a better grab on things .
neutral,"I think as long as you try your best and don ’ t think of anything too much , everything will be all right ."
neutral,"If you are really in love with your wife , you should be in support of her . You can ’ t have it both ways , of course ."
neutral,"Yeah . Love me , and love my dog ."
neutral,I saw her husband have it out with her yesterday .
neutral,Do you think people still have faith in the government ?
neutral,I don ’ t think so .
neutral,He began to be interested in finance because he thought he would be able to inherit the family ’ s fortune .
neutral,I have a big date tonight .
neutral,Mike has changed much after marriage .
neutral,Which flight ?
neutral,This is the result of women ’ s liberation .
neutral,"Now , many people think that women ’ s liberation is a kind of civilization , but children are getting less love from their mother because of that . What is your opinion ?"
neutral,Yes ? Anything I can do for you ?
neutral,Where is the baby ’ s mother ?
neutral,I ’ Ve ever seen a living being looked so thin .
neutral,Maybe you are right .
neutral,"Oh , why not ?"
neutral,"Yes , we are ."
neutral,"Well .. we're not sure yet , probably in St.Albans ."
neutral,"Hi , Sterling !"
neutral,I guess so .
neutral,Did you bring some lunch with you ?
neutral,Yes . May I help you ?
neutral,I ’ m a new student in the school . My name ’ s John .
neutral,"How can I lose weight , doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ?"
neutral,Would you like me to go with you ?
neutral,You mustn't go to bed very late . Can you be home before nine .
neutral,"Oh , dad , I'm not a child . I'm 17 already . I'll come back as soon as the film is over ."
neutral,"You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill ."
neutral,I'm sorry . I won't do it again .
neutral,How was the movie last night ?
neutral,Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
neutral,Do you know who ’ s just got married ? Old Mc Donald .
neutral,I suppose you're right.He can't have remembered .
neutral,"But you'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ?"
neutral,Yes . But only if you ask me nicely .
neutral,"Tom , darling . You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? Please !"
neutral,Ok . I'll keep my promise .
neutral,I ’ Ve got a fever and really a bad headache .
neutral,"Oh , that ’ s too bad . Why don ’ t you take some aspirin ?"
neutral,"Yeah , I guess I should ."
neutral,"Well , you ’ d better get some rest ."
neutral,"Sorry , I can ’ t ."
neutral,"Tomorrow night , then ?"
neutral,I ’ m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
neutral,"Ok . How about give me a ring , then ?"
neutral,Why not ?
neutral,"I agree with you in the sense . But we ’ re all more miserable than ever , aren ’ t we ?"
neutral,"Yes , I watched once ."
neutral,What do you think of it ?
neutral,Would you like to call home ?
neutral,I ’ d appreciate that .
neutral,I ’ ll stand in with you if you like . I ’ Ve got nothing else to do .
neutral,What do you mean ?
neutral,I think the Romans do what everyone else does .
neutral,How can I go there to have a taste ?
neutral,By air of course .
neutral,When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ?
neutral,"Jimmy , I ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . What do you think of it ?"
neutral,Let ’ s go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you .
neutral,Just last week .
neutral,How was it ?
neutral,Do you like coffee ?
neutral,Um . It ’ s delicious .
neutral,And do you like English food ?
neutral,"Oh , I forget.Sorry ."
neutral,Sure . I didn ’ t know you like mysteries .
neutral,"Yes , sir ?"
neutral,I used to play football regularly when I was at university.And I used to do athletics in the summer .
neutral,No . I'm afraid I haven't had time since I got married .
neutral,"Well , thank you again for coming to see us.But just remember that we like people who join the company to play in the company sports teams ."
neutral,What ?
neutral,"Sorry , I didn't think it mattered ."
neutral,"What do you mean ? We're talking now , aren't we ?"
neutral,Yes . I remember.But we never used to argue.You used to think I was wonderful.Where are you going ?
neutral,Sorry.What was that you said ?
neutral,I'll meet you at the Gate round about seven .
neutral,At the Gate .
neutral,What are you doing ? Is anything wrong ?
neutral,"Oh , yes , of course . I'm sorry-I wasn't thinking ..."
neutral,It's very dark in here.Will you turn on the light ?
neutral,That won't take long .
neutral,"Well , I'm not quite ready ."
neutral,"It ’ s a small world , isn ’ t it ?"
neutral,Don't you think we ' d leave for the concert now ?
neutral,What time dose it start ?
neutral,It will be Sunday so I expected everything will be closed .
neutral,Why not ?
neutral,What did you think of the film ?
neutral,Look at this one.It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
neutral,"Fine , thank you ."
neutral,"Very well , thank you . I ’ m meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12 , would you care to join us ?"
neutral,"I ’ m afraid a pencil won ’ t do . Wait a moment , I ’ ll find you one ."
neutral,"You seem to have something on mind . Promise me , go to see the doctor right now ."
neutral,I'm worrying about my exam .
neutral,A piece of cake . You'll be successful .
neutral,"Hello , Kith , can you and Alice come around this evening ? We prefer your coming ."
neutral,"The Johnson are on their way back.You remember them , don't you ?"
neutral,"No , I don't recall a thing about them ."
neutral,"Well , I've invited them for brunch ."
neutral,We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ?
neutral,Would you like me to give you a lift ?
neutral,What do you do for a living ?
neutral,I ’ m a doctor .
neutral,Where do you have to go .
neutral,How long do you have to be there ?
neutral,"Yes , but do you love me ?"
neutral,Why didn ’ t you answer my question ?
neutral,"Do you love me ? come on , I ’ m eager to hear ."
neutral,Yes . She goes three times a week .
neutral,I ’ m waiting for a bus and going for a walk in the park .
neutral,"Well , trains are frequent and come on time ."
neutral,I usually take the five thirty home .
neutral,And can you get a seat ?
neutral,"No , I usually have to stand ."
neutral,"By the way , could you tell me when the film will begin ?"
neutral,It will begin at five thirty .
neutral,Where are you going ?
neutral,What's he doing ?
neutral,He's fixing his roof .
neutral,"Fine , thank you.How are you doing this morning ?"
neutral,Aha . I've read of my roommate . I made a move today .
neutral,"Well , I swim and run every day ."
neutral,"Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs ."
neutral,What do you drink ?
neutral,I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter .
neutral,I do wish I could lose weight .
neutral,I've tried diets before but they've never worked .
neutral,To me English is a difficult language .
neutral,A second language is always difficult .
neutral,"Alison , would you like to have some more ?"
neutral,"Think of the big face down the eve , hmm ."
neutral,And also to frighten away evil spirits .
neutral,And my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year .
neutral,"Your family must be busy shopping for Christmas , now ."
neutral,Whose house warming party is it ?
neutral,"Well , it pays off for her.How old is she anyway ?"
neutral,"Going to the gym tonight , Mary ?"
neutral,What do you suggest I should see in New York ?
neutral,"Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ?"
neutral,"No , I don't like museums.They ' re boring ."
neutral,No regrets ?
neutral,"Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired ."
neutral,With the job ?
neutral,"It wasn't always like this , you know ."
neutral,"Well , I mean.We always do the same thing.There ' s no variety in our lives ."
neutral,Jack ! It ’ s Rose here .
neutral,"Hi , Rose . How ’ s everything ?"
neutral,Let's enter it !
neutral,She can't answer you .
neutral,"Hello , Jack here ."
neutral,"Sorry , I never go out on Saturday evening . I always watch football on Saturday evening ."
neutral,"Could you tell me what university you went to , Mr . Smith ?"
neutral,I have a B . A . in Economics .
neutral,And what was your salary at the bank ?
neutral,I got $ 500 a week .
neutral,I'm a teacher .
neutral,That ’ s a pity ! Then when would it be a good time for you ?
neutral,Did someone meet you at the airport here ?
neutral,"I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ..."
neutral,I heard that you went to the concert the day before ? How did you like it ?
neutral,It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months .
neutral,How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn .
neutral,Is it really worth paying for ?
neutral,I like taking photos out of doors .
neutral,You yourself have a photo studio ?
neutral,"Yes , but they are used for other things , too.Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris ."
neutral,Yes ?
neutral,That's right .
neutral,"Several things , for example , Various coins , stamps , stones and so on ."
neutral,Not right now . I've got to get another car and my old one is blown up .
neutral,"No , Ah ... single sellers ."
neutral,"Well , yeah , but I'd be getting somebody else's problem ."
neutral,"Hello , is that Cathy speaking ?"
neutral,"Morning , Mike ."
neutral,I will explain it in detail in the next class . Could you preview it ?
neutral,I will .
neutral,"Well , the weather is so unpredictable this time of year ."
neutral,You're right.We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow .
neutral,The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast .
neutral,"Yes , it is.But it's nice in spring and fall ."
neutral,Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month .
neutral,Yes .
neutral,It's the Powell orchestra .
neutral,They're doing a seventeenth-century program .
neutral,"Okay.Hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ?"
neutral,Is there a city where it's always warm ?
neutral,"Yes , there are many cities where it's almost always warm.San Diego , for example ."
neutral,"Well , do you think I have to ?"
neutral,Please look at the sky.Don ' t you see the dark clouds ? It's going to rain soon .
neutral,But I don't think it's so nice .
neutral,Why ?
neutral,Fine ! Do you want anything to eat now ?
neutral,"No , I'm not hungry ."
neutral,"No , what's up ?"
neutral,What would you like to be in the future ?
neutral,What's the problem ? You don't look happy .
neutral,It might be . You'd better take a heavy sweater with you.The nights are usually quite cold at this time of year .
neutral,Do you want a cigarette ?
neutral,"No , thank you . I've given up , you know ."
neutral,You don't mind if I have one .
neutral,"Well , all tight . But you know , smoking does do harm to your health ."
neutral,"Yes , you are right ."
neutral,"You're right , I'll change it . How about the last part ?"
neutral,"Yes , I have a three-year-old son ."
neutral,Which season do you like best ?
neutral,"Oh , everything comes back to life in spring and the weather gets warmer ."
neutral,"It's nice and bright today , isn't it ?"
neutral,Yeah.The autumn is marvelous here .
neutral,How about winter ?
neutral,"It's boring , right ?"
neutral,"To be frank , I was married once , and now I'm single ."
neutral,It's too hot to read .
neutral,How about summer ?
neutral,But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
neutral,What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ?
neutral,Stop producing cigarettes .
neutral,What do you plan to do on Sunday morning ?
neutral,"Oh , I'd rather not ."
neutral,Are you a smoker ?
neutral,When did you begin to smoke ?
neutral,I had my first cigarette when I was 17 .
neutral,How about this weekend ?
neutral,When are you off ?
neutral,I just dropped in to say good-bye .
neutral,What time are you leaving ?
neutral,What's the bonus like at your company ?
neutral,Maybe . But you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account .
neutral,"Hey , I know what that's like . I bought a BMW on my Visa card . Now the payments really hurt ."
neutral,"Well , you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments . I missed a credit payment last month . Now my bank account's overdrawn , and the company is threatening to take back my purchases ."
neutral,What did you buy ?
neutral,Was it ?
neutral,"I'm so sorry , I've been held up by the damn traffic jam for half an hour . I'd have arrived but for that ."
neutral,Thirty meters ahead is the Waterloo Bridge .
neutral,It doesn't matter.Bye .
neutral,So what ? Are we going anywhere ?
neutral,"I'm sorry , It's all my fault ."
neutral,We can't wait any longer ...
neutral,You'll knock yourself out the way you've worked.Why don't you slow down ?
neutral,"Excuse me , Miss Lin.Would you mind speaking up , please ? I can't hear you very well ."
neutral,"Oh I remember , I cut terrible calls , and you didn't say anything about it ."
neutral,"Come on , let ’ s try it ."
neutral,How about a movie tonight ?
neutral,Either way . I don ’ t care .
neutral,Are you really interested in doing something ?
neutral,I can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job .
neutral,"If I had chance again , I'd major in English . You're good at language ."
neutral,"You should take their advice . They know what's best for you.But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun , while I spend all my time doing reading and writing ."
neutral,"Where were you last night , at exactly nine twenty PM ?"
neutral,Were you in or out ? Can you remember that ?
neutral,Did you see anyone come into the block flats ?
neutral,A house warming party ?
neutral,"Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate 1 in this area is extremely expensive ."
neutral,"I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin ."
neutral,"Not at all . I see you and your family twice a week , and I enjoy seeing my own friends . I ’ m too busy to feel lonely !"
neutral,"Hello , Karl . I ’ m Chuck Jones . We ’ re going to be neighbors ."
neutral,I've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies ... but it looks like I'm going to need to make a claim .
neutral,If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered .
neutral,"Sure . Basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too ."
neutral,"I couldn't even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then I'd have to find my own place ."
neutral,"That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs ."
neutral,"Well , at least going to college won't be too bad . Since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college ."
neutral,"Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ?"
neutral,I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime .
neutral,"No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps ."
neutral,"Oh , I see . Yeah . Some people like traveling , some don ’ t . My husband didn ’ t like traveling at first , either . He said what ’ s the use of traveling ? A waste of money and a waste of time.At last I got him on the move . After all , he loved me . We went to Bali , Indonesia , one of the most beautiful places in the world . That trip left a very deep impression on him . Since then whenever we have holidays and money , we ’ d like to patronize the travel agency . Isn ’ t it a bit dull to shut yourself at one place all your life ?"
neutral,"How good are you at sports , Bill ?"
neutral,Wow !
neutral,And then what ?
neutral,That sounds boring to me .
neutral,What do you plan on doing after you retire ?
neutral,"Yes , I think I will do something new . I ’ Ve always wanted to be a teacher ."
neutral,All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers .
neutral,"Hi , Mr . Zhang . What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy . How was your date ?"
neutral,Have you noticed what has changed ?
neutral,Wow ! Sure !
neutral,I really want to pick your brain about something I've been thinking a lot about .
neutral,"Well , as you know , I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far , but I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work ... maybe even get a Doctorate !"
neutral,Wow ! Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain .
neutral,"I know education is expensive , but it's been my lifelong dream . Call me crazy , but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name ."
neutral,I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling . It's not as romantic as you might think .
neutral,Yeah ... I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate . I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare .
neutral,"Well , stress is a real thing . It's not an imaginary condition ."
neutral,"It's seriously affecting my life ! I can't sleep , I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered . Other people seem to handle stress okay ... why am I so weak ?"
neutral,"You're not weak ... you're stressed out ! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years . Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators ... and as you might imagine , that was pretty stressful ."
neutral,"Yeah , but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office . My stress is just about silly paperwork !"
neutral,"Oh ... Sure . We have an entire month ! In traditional Chinese culture , Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit ."
neutral,Yes ! How did you guess that ?
neutral,"But no dressing up like ghosts , right ?"
neutral,No ! So ... is Halloween essentially the same thing as ghost month ?
neutral,"Yes , I found a better house near my office . I ’ m very satisfied with it . But I ’ m worrying ."
neutral,"I ’ m worrying about how to move all of my household stuff . You know , I have a lot of stuff ."
neutral,You can call a mover .
neutral,How much dose that cost ?
neutral,What do you mean ?
neutral,Sounds like a pyramid scheme . Have you heard of those before ?
neutral,What happens then ?
neutral,"I know . It is a lot of money and I haven't gotten to know any of the people celebrating their birthdays well enough yet . At our old department , it was only three dollars for each birthday and there were only ten of us ."
neutral,What is that ?
neutral,I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs .
neutral,"Not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding ."
neutral,What do you mean by that ?
neutral,"Yes , but you only pay 800 dollars a month . Emm , it ’ s hard to decide which is better , shorter commuting time or lower rent ."
neutral,"I thought paying a lower rent would be better , but now I ’ m not sure ."
neutral,"Yes , if you consider 7-11 is a supermarket ."
neutral,I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years .
neutral,So what's Michael Milliken up to these days ?
neutral,He's giving lectures on business at colleges .
neutral,"It was a big , green thing that looked like a person . It was in the kitchen , and it slowly moved towards the stairs ..."
neutral,So what did you do ?
neutral,"Yeah , about ."
neutral,A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it .
neutral,I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time .
neutral,It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future .
neutral,"Don't forget my friend Andy from the office . He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over ."
neutral,I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . It's only a superstition . It really doesn't mean anything .
neutral,That's better .
neutral,"Well , I believe it now , and when are they are getting marry ?"
neutral,Next june .
neutral,What'd he do ?
neutral,I suppose I do .
neutral,It sure is .
neutral,"Well , If you live in other as long enough you love them just as much ."
neutral,When poyou have to see her ?
neutral,What does he look like ? Can people tell ?
neutral,"Yes , people surely can . He ’ s whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though ."
neutral,I don't know.Maybe they are really crazy .
neutral,"Well , it's true.The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul ."
neutral,"I think so.Yes , they get along so well ."
neutral,"Well , what about it ? As it happens I've got two tickets for next thursday evening . I thought perhaps ."
neutral,"Thursday ? Oh , sorry . I meant thursday too . I mean I busy then too ."
neutral,You seem to be in a hurry .
neutral,Yes . I ’ Ve got a meeting in a minute .
neutral,"David , I ’ m going to China ."
neutral,I will be all right soon . I was terrified when I watched them fall from the wire .
neutral,Don't worry.He is an acrobat 。
neutral,"Not so well . To be honest with you , I broke up with Tom ."
neutral,I will .
neutral,"No , thanks ."
neutral,"Well , I hope you ’ ll feel better soon ."
neutral,I ’ Ve changed my mind .
neutral,"Well , he ’ s got dark hair and brown eyes ."
neutral,"John , I ’ d like you to meet Charles Brown , our new manager at the airport ."
neutral,Is there anything else ?
neutral,Well . I shouldn ’ t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ?
neutral,What color is her hair ?
neutral,"No , do you want to go and do something ?"
neutral,"You are studying here , aren ’ t you ?"
neutral,Yes . I have been here for three years .
neutral,What a party ! I hope you don ’ t expect the girls to fish .
neutral,"These girls are different , they are not wimpy ."
neutral,When is the last time you talked to you parents ?
neutral,Are you going to see them soon ?
neutral,"I am going to go home after the holidays and we're going to have a Christmas kind of in January or February . Yeah , depending on when my brother can come in ."
neutral,Not particularly . I was rather disappointed .
neutral,And how about your Spanish ?
neutral,How well can you speak them ?
neutral,Where did you learn it ?
neutral,But everything has been so easy .
neutral,"Okay . Have it your way , but don't say I didn't warn you ."
neutral,I drink a lot of wine .
neutral,"If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much ."
neutral,"You know , I often have to work til late at night . I need something to keep me awake ."
neutral,"At his last start-up , Bob worked for stock and no salary . They folded and he made zip ."
neutral,"Vince , I think one of your programmers is spying on us for WebTracker ."
neutral,It isn't Elvin .
neutral,"Hey , Zina . You're here early today ."
neutral,"Yeah , I'm going to be making phone calls all day . What a blast ."
neutral,"You guys are working around the clock , I know . That guy Dave next to Zina never leaves ."
neutral,"You wouldn't ! If you leave , you'll make nothing ."
neutral,"I might make nothing even if I stay . For that kind of risk , I want to get rich ."
neutral,We'd better get back to work .
neutral,"Yeah , I'm not too worried about Vince , but I'd hate to face Zina if we don't deliver ..."
neutral,Vince says he can't afford anybody else . We're got to come through .
neutral,"He's just a distraction , like a mosquito buzzing in my ear . I want no distractions ."
neutral,"Zina , can I talk to you about something personal ?"
neutral,My boyfriend says I work too much . That I spend more time with you than with him .
neutral,"OK , Ann , you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that ?"
neutral,"I really liked living in Australia . I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney . And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney . There are lots of great clubs . And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney ."
neutral,I was there for almost a year .
neutral,Exactly .
neutral,Hello Todd .
neutral,We're going to talk about Australia . Or your going to talk about Australia . So first of all how any people live in Australia ?
neutral,OK . What are the biggest cities ?
neutral,I see .
neutral,"It could be and so in that case you might want to eat something perhaps more nutritious or maybe even less of what you do eat . Maybe , I eat three meals a day and I try not to snack in between . No potato chips . No popcorn . No candy bars ."
neutral,Really ? But you were in first class ! Nobody woke that guy up ?
neutral,That's terrible ! So you didn't get any sleep ?
neutral,"Don't push your luck , Dave ."
neutral,"I guess I'm just a little nervous . I'm giving everything I have to invoking , and ..."
neutral,"Well . I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . But ... if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price ."
neutral,"Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs . The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items , you can figure out the relative prices of everything else ."
neutral,"So , so you're British , do you missing them ?"
neutral,"I don ’ t know . I don ’ t mind coming out here for a while , but that will get old pretty soon ."
neutral,That ’ s what I was thinking . I mean can you imagine Friday night instead of going out with your friends you ’ d have to stay in your tree house and talk to birds and squirrels .
neutral,I think I ’ d go lonely if I do like that .
neutral,Maybe . But I ‘ d rather be spoiled than turn into a crazy guy with a long period to talk to the birds .
neutral,"Way to go , Mary . A lot has happened during the last few months , hasn't it ?"
neutral,You can say that again !
neutral,They work for Zina now .
neutral,They're in awe of her . After they saw how she crushed WebTracker ... but I guess you know all about that .
neutral,"It ’ s Saturday , a great weekend ."
neutral,It ’ s an anniversary of our weeding .
neutral,He has no sense .
neutral,But Joe won't you .
neutral,Does he know that he has already at his wits ' end ?
neutral,He might be driven up a wall . You should not handle your relation with him with kid gloves .
neutral,"But when I noticed that he was left in the cold , I could not help wanting to help him to get out of the situation ."
neutral,My son came home from three years in the navy .
neutral,How do you know that ?
neutral,"At least , it is better than my boxed lunch at work . I'm so fed up with the bland food . Thank you for having lunch with me !"
neutral,Eating is important . You are what you eat . It's not only a daily routine .
neutral,No . I'm going to pay the bill for the company's lunch .
neutral,"That's really smart . My son Daniel is the same with your son . I just don't get it , why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food ."
neutral,Sandra is actually blue chipper . I don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women .
neutral,I feel sorry for her .
neutral,"Good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ?"
neutral,How can you get that done ?
neutral,"Well , we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified . And he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan for your needs ."
neutral,"That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year ."
neutral,It's been 3 years now .
neutral,"Hurry up , Daniel , it's Barbie time ."
neutral,"All right , Sis !"
neutral,"Come on , it's cool outside ."
neutral,I like to watch Barbie sticking her tongue out .
neutral,When did you begin to smoke ?
neutral,I don't know . It's still up in the air .
neutral,How about summer ?
neutral,But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
neutral,It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others .
neutral,"Well , it ’ s hard to say . I coughed a lot in the evening ."
neutral,You ’ re right . But you know it ’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking .
neutral,Does your watch keep good time ?
neutral,Thank you .
neutral,"Oh , it ’ s time to have lunch now ."
neutral,Whose house warming party is it ?
neutral,It's out in the suburbs .
neutral,Are you married ?
neutral,Does she make any sense to you ?
neutral,I hear you and James are engaged at last .
neutral,When are you getting married ?
neutral,"Oh , lovely . Where's the wedding going to be ?"
neutral,At school . And I'm still learning it now .
neutral,A little French .
neutral,"That's a hard time . The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy ."
neutral,"It's boring , right ?"
neutral,So you should bring an umbrella often .
neutral,Good afternoon !
neutral,"Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot ."
neutral,Yes .
neutral,What's the weather like in your country ?
neutral,Where do you live ?
neutral,Here.Near this school .
neutral,You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave .
neutral,Did you go to the concert last weekend ?
neutral,"No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ?"
neutral,There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ?
neutral,"It's a piano recital . I'm fond of piano , you know ."
neutral,"Yes , simple as it is . t does work ."
neutral,I heard that you went to the concert the day before ? How did you like it ?
neutral,Who was the conductor ?
neutral,I do.We haven't watered them for quite a few days .
neutral,But why do so many people live there ?
neutral,"Most people grow accustomed to the climate , but there are many others who complain about it all the time ."
neutral,The weatherman predicts a fine day today .
neutral,The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast .
neutral,A week ago ? They met last summer and now just sink . They will be married soon .
neutral,"Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much ."
neutral,Who is he marring ?
neutral,When ’ re you getting married ?
neutral,"Julie ’ s friend , Mary . And John will be the best man ."
neutral,"Oh , I see ."
neutral,Very much.What time ?
neutral,About 6 .
neutral,"I like blue . You see , that's the color of the sky . I wanna be a superman ."
neutral,"Mom , it's OK . I will buy a big car one day . It is faster than the bus ."
neutral,You can do it . But do work hard on your English to make it easier .
neutral,I eat more and more these days . And it puts even more weight on me .
neutral,Do you think it's a good option for health and relaxation ?
neutral,"That's a long way to go , I'm afraid . First of all , you gotta grow up ."
neutral,Sure . Then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope .
neutral,Please change your clothes first !
neutral,"Sorry , but no jeans here ."
neutral,"Mom , this is your third bowl of rice !"
neutral,I've been going to the gym these days . The exercise makes me hungry all the time .
neutral,Surely not . I can feel the results . I'm starting to feel different now .
neutral,I'm planning to meet my personal trainer to have the work-out plan fixed .
neutral,"Come on , just a little piece ."
neutral,"Come on , you are making too big deal out of this ."
neutral,He used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him .
neutral,How respectable !
neutral,"Well , I admit . The ghosts were scary ."
neutral,Of course you do . They are silly stories just for little kids like you .
neutral,Many customers didn't want them .
neutral,What's your little caper ? Come home so late ! We are all worried about you .
neutral,"It is just pop song , you could have sung there too if you want it ."
neutral,Many oil painting exhibitions are there . That is a kind of Museum Exhibition .
neutral,But I still prefer the pop music in the subway .
neutral,"Dad , you talk well , but can you appreciate that kind of art ?"
neutral,I'm sure of what I'm doing .
neutral,Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop clock .
neutral,Why did Tom quit the job ?
neutral,"But anyway , I'll have a try ."
neutral,But Mrs.Smith hired him to find her lost son .
neutral,He has a girlfriend already .
neutral,Many people like him get a flying start but soon disappear .
neutral,Why doesn't he ask her ?
neutral,He is too scared to ask her .
neutral,He's a chicken guy .
neutral,I wonder how Sarah and Mat are .
neutral,I'm not surprised . She's a plain Jane .
neutral,Such friends are even worse than enemies .
neutral,She'd better keep away from them .
neutral,Does your wife work ?
neutral,"Oh , I understand . She cooks , cleans and takes care of children . Is that right ?"
neutral,You are really a hen-pecked husband .
neutral,I decided to go for this kind of life .
neutral,I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst .
neutral,"Right . Sorry . Anyway , the radio said that it'll rain later today ."
neutral,I thought you had trouble with Clive !
neutral,Come on . Two is company .
neutral,They have moved to some other places long time ago .
neutral,Me too ! I was lost three times ten years ago . There were no English directions then .
neutral,"Oh , I love Michael Jordan . He fills people's lives with great excitement ."
neutral,Used to . But now he is too old to play in a fierce game like this . But Kobe is the upcoming superstar now .
neutral,That is not true . They are just jealous of him !
neutral,"You know what , he is also an outstanding football player . He is surely to be a star of tomorrow ."
neutral,"Wow , this is drop-dead gorgeous ."
neutral,So no more regret now ?
neutral,Don't remind me of that . This would be the last time I cut any classes for a basketball game .
neutral,"It's only seven minutes into the game , too early to cheer up ."
neutral,"Wait , that guy , I know him . He is just a bench warmer ."
neutral,"Well , don't do this again next time . What is it about , anyway ?"
neutral,Can I have my magazine back now ?
neutral,"Deal , Where is Gucci ?"
neutral,She is the cheer-leader . They are required to put on a performance . Look ! Here they come .
neutral,"Oh , look at her . She looks like one is the basketball babies in NBA ."
neutral,"Hey , young man ! I'm your sis . Don't talk to me like that ."
neutral,"Come on , you are left behind !"
neutral,"Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey ."
neutral,You just need more exercise .
neutral,Be brave . Don't worry . You will be able to walk soon .
neutral,I see . But isn't it a bit too noisy ?
neutral,"Hey , what sort of drinks do you want ? Gatorade or water ?"
neutral,"That ’ s for sure . During the back court , we should change the position we played ."
neutral,I agree with you . I think we ’ ll play much better than before .
neutral,"Well , you should ask your friend . You know I ’ m not the boss . Just kidding ."
neutral,"Hurry up ! Mom , I can't wait any more ."
neutral,"Rockets vs Lakers . Yao Ming , my idol , will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience ."
neutral,It's amazing . And when did he begin to play in the NBA ?
neutral,I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game .
neutral,"That's really terrible . Oh , God , we forgot to cheer for Daddy ."
neutral,"Never mind . After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming , right ?"
neutral,Did your teacher tell you the route he took ?
neutral,"Hello , is it necessary to do warm-up exercise ? I can't wait to dive into the water ."
neutral,"OK , lovely boy . Try to be patient . Do you know the danger of swimming without warm-up ?"
neutral,That's right . But the most dangerous thing is that their legs may spasm out of control when swimming .
neutral,"Yes , besides that , we also provide our customers with goggles , swimming suit and something like that ."
neutral,"Oh , don't worry about that here . There are security guards on duty 24 hours a day and they patrol all over the neighborhood . You know , they are all very strong ."
neutral,Of course . There is a Carrefour near the neighborhood . I'll show you there if you want to .
neutral,"If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that ."
neutral,"Oh , yeah . Thought I am an American , I know quite a lot about China and I like Chinese tea very well ."
neutral,Both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . And I usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
neutral,You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too .
neutral,Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
neutral,What about in China ? What'd you do to celebrate your birthday ?
neutral,You can decide later . You will have choices before you submit your university application form .
neutral,Right . I have lots of time to think carefully before I make my final decision .
neutral,Did you notice the characters on the lanterns ?
neutral,It's really eye-catching . It's the biggest dragon lantern I've ever seen in all my life .
neutral,"There are many Chinese characters on its body , too . What are they about ? Puzzles ?"
neutral,I am not sure . You can search for them on the Internet .
neutral,"3,000 Yuan is a little bit steep ."
neutral,Don't worry . Let's check out some other schools .
neutral,Of course I know . I just can't see it very well .
neutral,"Actually , it likes milk too ."
neutral,Do you know other famous animals in the world ?
neutral,"On their bus or in your own cars , and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region ."
neutral,Why not ?
neutral,Yes .
neutral,I prefer to go there next time .
neutral,No way . I will be scared out of my wits .
neutral,"Yeah , It seems like we don't talk the same language as far as movies are concerned ."
neutral,Not quite . I also like romance and comedy movies very much .
neutral,He has a glib tongue . Few people can argue him down .
neutral,Yeah . She married him at her mother's bidding .
neutral,That give us a good lesson .
neutral,That's a relief for me and a misery for the children .
neutral,Why don't you make up with John .
neutral,"Your husband is very helpful , isn't he ?"
neutral,Last night he told the children a cliff-hanger story and both of them were scared out of sleep .
neutral,But I heard that she had a three-year-old girl .
neutral,May doesn't get along very well with her mother-in-law .
neutral,This situation isn't easy to handle .
neutral,You know that ? Dan got a divorce .
neutral,You're right . I will have a talk to her about that .
neutral,Yeah . I have got much pressure in the company . I have to be wrapped up in my work .
neutral,Yeah .
neutral,Just because he gets on well with everybody ?
neutral,I went to Paris .
neutral,To be a revolutionary needs great courage !
neutral,"I tell ya , when I got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . You've done a complete 180 ."
neutral,I guess so .
neutral,"No , this is my first . Last week I went to a cookout 5 for new professors at Dean Barksdale's home . I took a taxi because I didn't want to be late . But I was the first one there ."
neutral,Huh ?
neutral,"Actually , I'd forgotten about it ."
neutral,I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ?
neutral,"Well , I'll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that's not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I'll just enjoy the holiday break ."
neutral,"Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries ."
neutral,What ’ s the difference between this and other Churches ?
neutral,"That means that they all have parts of the original gospel , but not all ."
neutral,It's idea of my husband . He is always banging the drum for better schools .
neutral,"No , it isn't mine . I blundered upon it under the sofa . Do you know whose watch it is ?"
neutral,The mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .
neutral,What ? It ’ s only 9 p . m . Now . Why today he went to bed so early ?
neutral,"Oh , I see ."
neutral,He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
neutral,It is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas .
neutral,So the reform can not be carried out well .
neutral,Of course not .
neutral,I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing .
neutral,I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter .
neutral,I see you have bought some coffee . Would you mind telling me how much you paid for it ?
neutral,What do you suggest I should see in New York ?
neutral,"Sorry , what was your last name again ?"
neutral,"Ok , I'm Tom ."
neutral,Me ? I'm in the car business .
neutral,With the job ?
neutral,"It wasn't always like this , you know ."
neutral,"Certainly , perhaps ."
neutral,"Hi , dear , do you know what the important day is today ?"
neutral,Please think it over .
neutral,"Come on , dear . I know you mustn ’ t forget it ."
neutral,Don ’ t be angry with me . I have a bad memory .
neutral,What day is it on earth ?
neutral,It ’ s an anniversary of our weeding .
neutral,You won't be late . It's still early .
neutral,Do I need a visa ?
neutral,"I doubt it , I'll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth ."
neutral,That ’ s my little secret . Did you like the snacks that I prepared ?
neutral,All cleaned up . Are you ready to start on the washing up ?
neutral,Yes . I ’ Ve read news about him in today ’ s paper .
neutral,Good luck to them .
neutral,I really hate receiving spam . I also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway .
neutral,It would be very hard work . Are you sure ?
neutral,You ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . It ’ s not something you can just walk into .
neutral,What kinds of Tv programs do you enjoy watching ?
neutral,That ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the Tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?
neutral,No . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on Tv in your country ?
neutral,"There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , Thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many sports events in my city . We have several sports venues for football , rugby , and cricket-even ice-skating and ice hockey ."
neutral,Is there a lot of nightlife in your city ?
neutral,"I think that for a lot of people , it ’ s just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries ."
neutral,"You are so pessimistic ! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed , skill , agility and strength . Most people hope to see someone from their country win , but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete ."
neutral,"When I was at school , I was quite good at track and field events . I was on the school team for the long jump , 100 and 200 meter sprints and the javelin ."
neutral,I thought you were good at the high jump !
neutral,"I was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters . I usually did well in the dong jump competitions , but I couldn ’ t compete with kids from other schools in the javelin . How about you ?"
neutral,"Yes , I did , but I didn ’ t do very well . I made the final in both events , but came last . At least I made the final . I was very pleased with that ."
neutral,I was just watching a documentary on TV about how people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting .
neutral,"I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers ."
neutral,What are you doing ?
neutral,The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate .
neutral,Both our countries are quite small . How would you describe the landscape in your country ?
neutral,"There are many lakes and rivers in your country too . We also have many rivers , but only a few lakes ."
neutral,What do you think of the way people use and treat animals ?
neutral,"According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation ."
neutral,which countries have you been to ?
neutral,isn ’ t it really cold there ?
neutral,"Yes . The other large cities are Chengdu , Dalian , Wuhan , tianjin , shenyang , Chongqing . Hongkong and Guangzhou ."
neutral,I just got back from London .
neutral,How was your flight ?
neutral,That ’ s too bad . How long was the flight ?
neutral,"Yes , in Paris , France ."
neutral,Did you buy anything in the duty-free stores ?
neutral,"There ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ?"
neutral,"Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ’ t go into detail , but it wasn ’ t serious ."
neutral,I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital .
neutral,Is there any pain now ?
neutral,"I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much ."
neutral,I understand that he ’ s connected to a heart monitor and breathing apparatus . His condition can ’ t be very good .
neutral,The hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable . What does that mean ?
neutral,What ’ s your favourite ball sport ?
neutral,Do they have a good team ?
neutral,Hello ! How are you .
neutral,What have you got ? A cough ? A cold ?
neutral,Perhaps you ’ Ve been working too hard . You do have a high-pressure job .
neutral,Maybe . I haven ’ t been able to keep my food down either . That ’ s unusual .
neutral,"OK . Hope you feel better soon . You should take it easy . I ’ m sure the doctor will prescribe rest , you know ."
neutral,Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
neutral,Of course ! I bought two copies .
neutral,"I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ’ re famous , so everyone loves them ."
neutral,"I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ?"
neutral,"No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party ."
neutral,"I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored ."
neutral,I think you should give them some credit . They ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves .
neutral,I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
neutral,"When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email from companies trying to sell you things ."
neutral,That ’ s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time you want to visit .
neutral,no-one really believes gossip columnists .
neutral,"This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee !"
neutral,How often do you run your anti-virus program ?
neutral,I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time .
neutral,Which anti-virus program would you recommend ?
neutral,That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ?
neutral,"I use it almost every day , but I usually only use it to check my email . I don ’ t often surf the net . You use the internet a lot , don ’ t you ?"
neutral,"So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them ."
neutral,Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive .
neutral,The problem is that many poor people might suffer .
neutral,What do you mean ?
neutral,I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ?
neutral,But it ’ s so old .
neutral,"So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?"
neutral,Do you think children watch too much Tv ?
neutral,"I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone ."
neutral,Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .
neutral,Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?
neutral,Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way .
neutral,Critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ Ve made recently . Does that bother you ?
neutral,Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think .
neutral,Which language do you speak ?
neutral,Who is he ?
neutral,He ’ s a famous American musician .
neutral,It ’ s an article about language . It talks about the idea of having a single global language .
neutral,It seems that English already is the main global language . Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language .
neutral,I thought I ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there .
neutral,I have one daughter and one son . Then there ’ s my husband and I . What about your parents ? Do they live with your family ?
neutral,"It ’ s becoming more and more common . However , I don ’ t ever want to get divorced myself ! What about you ?"
neutral,"If that happens , maybe you could marry my brother and we could become in-laws !"
neutral,I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character .
neutral,I think that ’ s true with any of the fine arts .
neutral,"Oh , I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress ."
neutral,Maybe we should try a thai massage too .
neutral,"Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks ."
neutral,"What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ?"
neutral,Cindy ’ s husband is Ron .
neutral,They have two children-one son and one daughter-as well as one daughter-in-law and one son-in-law .
neutral,"Yes , she gets along with them quite well ."
neutral,I just make eye contact with him and nod my head . Then I tell him when he comes over to the table . Why do you ask ?
neutral,I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
neutral,That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
neutral,"Well , it was a warm evening , so I stretched my legs . I walked along the canal for a couple of miles . Actually , several other people had the same idea . I saw Bill ."
neutral,You ’ re right . I love going out and making new friends .
neutral,How do you think people get their personalities ?
neutral,Don ’ t you think people get their personalities from their parents ?
neutral,1 thirty P . m . But I've got to check in at 12 thirty P . m .
neutral,Do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
neutral,"No , never . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever met a girl taller than me ! Have you gained weight recently ?"
neutral,What do you do for a living ?
neutral,She works as a teller in a bank .
neutral,Why do you say that ?
neutral,I'm sorry to hear that . Take care of yourself .
neutral,"Oh , I have been with my uncle for a week ."
neutral,Good evening . Welcome to our program .
neutral,Did you drive yourself to the airport ?
neutral,Did someone meet you at the airport here ?
neutral,Hi ! How are you going ?
neutral,"Almost . I ’ Ve put up the decorations , and we ’ Ve decorated the Christmas tree with plenty of tinsel and baubles ."
neutral,"I like the big star on the top of the tree . I ’ ll put the presents under the tree later , how ’ s the food ."
neutral,Yes . I ’ Ve bought all the things to go in it . It won ’ t take long to make . How many people are coming to the party ?
neutral,I think everyone will be coming . Dave don ’ t come because he has to go to his parent ’ s home and they live in Scotland .
neutral,There ’ s been a growth in that field in my country too . A lot of people want to learn practical and professional skills .
neutral,"That trend has already begun in my country . In particular , there ’ s a big demand for people to work in fitness centers . Which kinds of jobs are less in demand ?"
neutral,"Well , we could go to a movie . Have you see Shrek 2 ?"
neutral,I guess that ’ s out . Why don ’ t we go shopping ?
neutral,I don ’ t have a car .
neutral,No . do you have a car ?
neutral,Not yet . I ’ ll cook dinner and have it ready by the time you get here .
neutral,"Oh , right . I suppose so . As long as you promise to lose !"
neutral,"You are a sensible drinker . Anyway , I ’ m not going to drink any alcohol this evening . I don ’ t ’ want another bad hangover ."
neutral,That ’ s great . He ’ s the best runner I ’ Ve seen this season . I ’ m sure he ’ ll win a medal at the Olympics .
neutral,We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice .
neutral,How well can you speak them ?
neutral,Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ?
neutral,You're going to get into a lot of trouble if you do that .
neutral,"Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork . Just like we planned ! That may be true , but if you were to do it , you would have trouble on the horizon . You always say that ."
neutral,Maybe .
neutral,"Well , if I were you , I'd go on studying ."
neutral,"If I had chance again , I'd major in English . You're good at language ."
neutral,But you should make up your mind first .
neutral,"About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world ."
neutral,Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom .
neutral,He's got a promotion .
neutral,Well . Good for him .
neutral,"No , have they have another fight ?"
neutral,You don't think you could be wrong ?
neutral,This is right . There is no doubt in my mind .
neutral,Yes . I dare say it will be .
neutral,"Mmm , you may be right ."
neutral,Do you think we ’ ll need our overcoats ?
neutral,Is that very likely in England ?
neutral,"When in Rome , do as the Romans do , they say ."
neutral,"Sam , what shall I do with my stocks ? Will I lose money ?"
neutral,Is that so ?
neutral,"Hi , how ’ re you doing ?"
neutral,"Oh , what ’ s the matter ?"
neutral,I ’ Ve got a fever and really a bad headache .
neutral,"I save money in a post office saving account . There used to be just one kind of account , but now there are several . They each have different conditions and interest rates ."
neutral,Do you think that the service at post offices has improved ?
neutral,I like being able to buy newspapers and magazines at the post office . It means that I don ’ t need to go to two places
neutral,I need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if I die .
neutral,Maybe . I ’ m not sure why they have fashion shows like this . Hardly anyone will buy those clothes . The clothes you see are nothing like the ones that ordinary people wear . It seems like a waste of money .
neutral,You meant it ’ s an expression of their fantasies ?
neutral,Which service offered by your bank do you use most ?
neutral,"I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from once currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see ."
neutral,Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit .
neutral,"Yes , I do . It save me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines ."
neutral,What ’ s the first thing you do when you go to the bathroom in the morning ?
neutral,Do you brush your teeth twice a day as dentists recommend ?
neutral,"Yes . I brush my teeth in the morning , just before I go to work . It ’ s actually the last thing I do before leaving . Then I brush again before bed ."
neutral,"Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry ."
neutral,Did you lend him a lot of money ?
neutral,Are you taking anything ?
neutral,"Judy , what is everybody talking about ?"
neutral,Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company .
neutral,It must be a haunted house . Are you frightened ?
neutral,what's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired .
neutral,"I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ?"
neutral,"Well , I've lost my wallet and my ID card ."
neutral,"It's an easy way to get hurt , let me tell you ."
neutral,Be careful of yourself .
neutral,I ’ ll be very glad if you would help .
neutral,"Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?"
neutral,When were you Bron may I ask ?
neutral,What's the color of her eyes ?
neutral,How old is she ?
neutral,Guess who I saw yesterday ?
neutral,My cousin Monk . Have you seen her lately ?
neutral,"Oh , she is ."
neutral,"No , I wouldn't think so ."
neutral,"Well , why don't you go on the diet ?"
neutral,You too . Have you lost some weight ?
neutral,"Now , tell me , what do you eat ?"
neutral,What do you drink ?
neutral,"Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you ."
neutral,Where did you have it done ?
neutral,Johnson ? I can't place them .
neutral,"No , I don't recall a thing about them ."
neutral,"Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together ."
neutral,I went to the doctor yesterday .
neutral,Medicine .
neutral,"Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ?"
neutral,I went to Harvard University .
neutral,"Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A ."
neutral,"Oh , French dressing ."
neutral,Why not ?
neutral,"Well , will you please put them down ?"
neutral,"Oh , you've got a good memory ."
neutral,"I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ..."
neutral,Is it very interesting ?
neutral,"If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book ."
neutral,It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months .
neutral,Is it really worth paying for ?
neutral,I've just been reading an article about them . They'll be used for all sorts of things now .
neutral,"Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class ."
neutral,I ’ Ve got a new boss .
neutral,Yes .
neutral,"Tomorrow night , then ?"
neutral,I ’ m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
neutral,No . I ’ d better not .
neutral,"No , she ’ s average ."
neutral,It ’ s blond .
neutral,Of course . I often go to the movies .
neutral,Here it is . It starts at 8 o'clock .
neutral,Um ?
neutral,As you like .
neutral,I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise .
neutral,That is just an excuse . You can always find some time to exercise .
neutral,How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ?
neutral,A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China .
neutral,Why ? To welcome the new year of course ?
neutral,"Oh , that's why my parents never scold me that day . They always try to avoid tears and quarrels ."
neutral,"Ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate to return ."
neutral,What do you mean ? It will help us to relax .
neutral,"Hi charles , I want you know that I finally found an apartment in Haitian ."
neutral,Around seven .
neutral,"Wow , Good for you . It sounds like a lot of work . I'm proud of you ! Is this the red of building ?"
neutral,"Yeah , I ’ Ve just moved here , and I ’ d like to activate my cell phone , and I ’ m not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan , or a monthly rate plan ."
neutral,"Chips , finger foods , desserts , baked beans . Where're the pork and beef strips ?"
neutral,You can put stuff on the picnic table . Back to work . The grill is calling me ...
neutral,Sounds like an Italian name with an “ i ” at the end .
neutral,Don't we all ... hey ! Your cousin sells gift items ?
neutral,"No , but someone said he was in the men's room puking . Follow me !"
neutral,Is that your cousin in the back ?
neutral,And I heard that Italian men have very active libidos .
neutral,What kind of girl is she ?
neutral,About 30 . He's really outgoing . But why do you ask ?
neutral,"Hey , guys !"
neutral,"I'm so sorry , Taylor . Go talk to her . I'm sure she'd be happy to see you ."
neutral,I'd love that . I'm so glad I quit . It's time for a change .
neutral,Ah ! I know a way to convince him that Americans can make good Italian food !
neutral,How's that ?
neutral,"Oh , I can't . I have a date !"
neutral,"Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ?"
neutral,I can't believe Mr . Fro didn't buy it . Who does that guy think he is anyway ? Bill Gates ?
neutral,I'm not . I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today . Why ? Do you think I'm fat ?
neutral,"Balista , pull me a ristretto ."
neutral,What ? You're suddenly some kind of coffee snob now ? What's a ristretto anyway ?
neutral,Sounds like it must be just full of caffeine . I want one of those instead !
neutral,"Boy , it looks like everyone in your family is here , from young to old ."
neutral,"A man sent Miss Smith flowers , and Bryan got kicked out of class !"
neutral,"Yes . But if I have any more soup , I think I'll die ."
neutral,Whatever ... Smell ! Perfume samples !
neutral,You mean it shuts off to save energy ?
neutral,"Yep . And it breathes , see !"
neutral,"Jen , it's not alive ... but it does look user-friendly ."
neutral,You'll never guess what happened today ! I went to the doctor after work and the doctor told me ...
neutral,Not yet . I'm not finished with my research yet .
neutral,What research ?
neutral,Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ?
neutral,But they're just ads ...
neutral,These things are always oooo boring . Heard any gossip ? Anybody making the big bucks ?
neutral,Teresa Jones got a boob job .
neutral,"Uh , I can see that . And Erica Falls has lost a lot of weight ."
neutral,"Oh , yes , it does . Look , here it says that the CD-ROM is built-in !"
neutral,Totally cool colors !
neutral,Of course . I'm currently the subscriber of 10 different fashion magazines .
neutral,"Sweet little lassie . Yep , broke her heart when the D-man told her he couldn't be a one-woman guy ."
neutral,To a historic coffeehouse . It's got a little Mafia story to it .
neutral,Maybe he was just visiting someone .
neutral,"But you saw how skinny and pale he looks . He has "" cancer patient "" written all over his face ."
neutral,"Your boyfriend , Bryan , wanted to toss the football . I think he wore me out ."
neutral,"Yeah , you look a little shaky . And pale . You seriously need some time in the sun ."
neutral,Is that a kind of alcohol ?
neutral,I'll take over for a while to give you a break .
neutral,Then I'll tell folks the food's ready . Come and get it ! I've always wanted to say that !
neutral,"You were when we were in high school . That , and baseball ."
neutral,"True , but I still have to watch my baseball . The season's in full swing now ."
neutral,... and for us to get tans in our new bikinis .
neutral,Why ? Are they good ?
neutral,Ummmph !
neutral,Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched .
neutral,"Hi , Mr . Smith . Are you enjoying the cookout ? You don't look too happy ."
neutral,I'm sorry to hear that . Thank you for telling me a little more about it .
neutral,"Yes , something called “ George W . Bush . ” An hour later , all I see are pictures of George W . Bush in women's clothes ."
neutral,"Yeah , their expressions were exactly the same !"
neutral,"A garage sale ... that's where people check out cars , right ?"
neutral,That's good to know . We'll watch for crazy drivers .
neutral,Such a thing exists ?
neutral,He's such a buppie-a black yuppie . Black people come in all shapes and sizes . Just check out the party .
neutral,Then I'll just shut up and sit down !
neutral,"What have you been up to , Johnny ?"
neutral,"Wow , your grandma's really having a field day with you , huh ?"
neutral,"Sure thing , Johnny . Watch out for dishpan hands there , kid !"
neutral,I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try and I have been here for 2 years already !
neutral,"Graduate Management Admission Test , it contains three parts"
neutral,"Okay , this sounds a little tough , how am I supposed to practice for this ?"
neutral,"No , tell me more ."
neutral,Come on ! You can just walk up to a girl and say “ If you were a booger I \ ' d pick you first . ”
neutral,"Fine , then you can say , “ So there you are ! I ' Ve been looking all over for YOU , the woman of my dreams ! ”"
neutral,I don ' t buy into that . I think it ' s just a fad . Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into wear-wolves or zombies !
neutral,"Yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . On top of all that , I have heard it hurts a lot !"
neutral,Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing !
neutral,"Yes and no . I can ' t wait to go to Europe , but at the same time I am terrified ."
neutral,"Well , I must confess I am a bit claustrophobic . I hate being in an elevator for more than 5 seconds ."
neutral,Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
neutral,That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying !
neutral,"Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ?"
neutral,"Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ’ t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . For example , never handle a weapon that you haven ’ t inspected yourself . Always make sure there isn ’ t anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot !"
neutral,What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ?
neutral,January 5th .
neutral,"No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize ."
neutral,"Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ?"
neutral,What are you doing ?
neutral,"Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me ."
neutral,"Whatever dude , I ’ m going to go watch the opening match ."
neutral,She what ?
neutral,See ? It ’ s going to be wonderful ! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of .
neutral,Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup .
neutral,The motorcycle ? But that ’ s mine !
neutral,Woo hoo ! This just might be the start of the rest of my life !
neutral,What happened ?
neutral,"Ben , we ’ re fifteen . What kind of job are you looking for ?"
neutral,"But I ’ m just in it for the money , right ? How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies ? Besides , I love the smell of gasoline , don ’ t you ?"
neutral,Yeah ? You finally decided to wipe the slate clean ?
neutral,So what are you going to do ? Take up an art class or something ?
neutral,"One last thing , I ’ Ve decided to come out of the closet ."
neutral,"Well , no , it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ?"
neutral,"Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea ."
neutral,Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
neutral,I ’ Ve been playing computer games .
neutral,Come on ! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn ’ t mind you going to her bachelorette party !
neutral,What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family !
neutral,"Let ’ s think this through . First of all , you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all , you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it !"
neutral,Are you trying to lose weight ?
neutral,Do you have a New Year's resolution ?
neutral,But it's almost midnight !
neutral,Really ? How do you know it was Santa ?
neutral,"Hmm ... well I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree , spying on him !"
neutral,"Oh , hi Melissa . Are you going to the conference too ? I was planning to pick up Mr . Campbell ."
neutral,"Definitely . Oh , there's Mr . Campbell . Driver , can you stop here please ?"
neutral,"Honey , I ’ ll be right back !"
neutral,Oh hi Jim . No I just got back . I thought you were on vacation now .
neutral,I'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference . I don't think we should continue with the TV advertising .
neutral,"Well , the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James . Once in the New World , they befriended an native named Squanto , who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn ."
neutral,For example ?
neutral,At least you ’ re doing your part . My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family .
neutral,I ’ m forming a music band .
neutral,Do you already know how to play an instrument ?
neutral,Ok ... I ’ ll talk to you later . Bye
neutral,"Carrie , are you ok ? You seem a bit down ."
neutral,What are you talking about ? Where is your Halloween spirit ? Didn ’ t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ?
neutral,"Of course , I did , but when I was ten ! Trick - or-treating is for kids , plus , I ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids NCP at night ."
neutral,"Whatever , I ’ m going next door I heard Mrs . Robinson is giving out big bags of M & Ms !"
neutral,"Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours , they ’ re no saints ."
neutral,Hey man ! Everything is just groovy baby !
neutral,"Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday ? I heard it was far out , man !"
neutral,"Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ?"
neutral,"Www , man !"
neutral,And then what happened ?
neutral,"If I told her that , she would faint and have me committed !"
neutral,"Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe ."
neutral,"There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH !"
neutral,"Sure thing . So , where are you flying in from ?"
neutral,That ’ s my brother !
neutral,"But this time I ’ m going to stick to it . I really mean it ! Trust me , Carol , I ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time !"
neutral,"Well , I guess we ’ ll just have to wait and see ."
neutral,"Thanks , honey , that was a great meal . I ’ m stuffed . Do we have any chips left ?"
neutral,You were right ! He didn ’ t make the shot !
neutral,"Okay ... end of the first quarter ... Alright , I ’ m gonna make a beer run ."
neutral,What are you doing in this neighbourhood ? Do you live around here ?
neutral,"Actually , my office is right around the corner ."
neutral,"Yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . You know , I'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion ."
neutral,"Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point ."
neutral,Yeah well it ’ s about time ! He ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years !
neutral,Thank you for your compliment . Won't you try this fish with white sauce ? I'm rather round of it .
neutral,I like beefsteak very much . Have you tried Chinese dishes ?
neutral,"Well , it's getting late . I have to get up early tomorrow . So I must say good night ."
neutral,"Yes , if that's all right for you ."
neutral,Forget about it .
neutral,"Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon ."
neutral,"Can you play a musical instrument ? If you can , he might ask you to join the band ."
neutral,"I love to try it , but the instrument is expensive and it was still need to take a lot of practice ."
neutral,"OK . If you really insist , I could always use the company ."
neutral,"Nothing really , why , what ' s up ?"
neutral,"No . thank you . I can handle it , but thanks for the offer ."
neutral,"Ok , I will see you then ."
neutral,Is there something any need ?
neutral,"Great , Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ?"
neutral,I'd like to call on you this weekend . I just want to a drop in for a chat .
neutral,"Hmm , how about seven ? I can treat you to dinner ."
neutral,I'll be there on time .
neutral,What kind of music do you like listening to ?
neutral,Are you ready to go to the bank ?
neutral,There ’ s problem with my bank statement . There ’ s a mistake on it . I also need to withdraw some money some the ATM .
neutral,I have to exchange some money .
neutral,"I heard that too . She must be making a pocket . Well , good for her ."
neutral,"You ’ re right . By the way , did you hear that Tom inherited some money recently ?"
neutral,They did . He inherited the money from an uncle . I hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government .
neutral,"He said that he would probably invest most of it . He ’ s got a well-paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses . He just wants some extra money available for when he retires ."
neutral,"No , but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a bonus for all the hard work I ’ Ve put in recently . I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way ."
neutral,"It certainly was ! So , what are you going to do with your windfall ?"
neutral,Yes . Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
neutral,What do you do there ?
neutral,Good night then .
neutral,See you tomorrow .
neutral,Me too . I ’ ll write to you once I get settled . But I have so much to do . You might have to wait a while . But I really will write to you . I love to write letters . I think it ’ s more meaning than the emails even than the phone call .
neutral,Look after yourself . Bye .
neutral,You ’ re leaving so soon . When are you off ?
neutral,I ’ m catching the 9 fifteen train tomorrow morning .
neutral,Of course . I will .
neutral,Ok . My next problem is to convert 10000 british pounds into us dollars . What ’ s the exchange rate at the moment ?
neutral,You ’ ll be a mathematician one day .
neutral,"No , thank you . I can ’ t ."
neutral,Not bad I guess . I just got back from Hawaii .
neutral,How was it ?
neutral,I had a good time . You seem to be in a hurry . Don't let me hold you up .
neutral,"Sorry , I've got a meeting in half an hour ."
neutral,Some people believe that a tough approach is better . Other prefer a more lenient approach .
neutral,It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .
neutral,There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ?
neutral,Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine .
neutral,What methods do you use to conserve water ?
neutral,"Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water ."
neutral,What are spring and autumn like ?
neutral,"Yes , they are like I said we have thunderstorms . But each one usually last a few hours . Then the skys are clear again ."
neutral,What book is that ?
neutral,"Canada , China , and the USA are huge too ."
neutral,That looks like an interesting book .
neutral,"It is . It ’ s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world , with brief descriptions of how they were build , their purpose , and so on ."
neutral,"They don ’ t now , but most of them did originally . There ’ s picture of the pentagon in the United States . It ’ s very distinctive with its five sides ."
neutral,How do you spend your afternoons ?
neutral,"I think you ’ re right . Climate change naturally over time , but I think that human activities are speeding up the change . I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem ."
neutral,I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in Iran .
neutral,Yes . There have been a few there recently . They say that this one was not a big quake . The Iranians are dealing with it on their own . They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried under rubble .
neutral,"So far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital ."
neutral,"There is some , but my country is not amongst the leading producers . The oil and coal deposits are in the north of my country . Your country is a big oil producer , isn ’ t it ?"
neutral,"No coal has been discovered in my country , but there may be undiscovered deposits . We don ’ t have many metal deposits ."
neutral,"There are a few in my country . We have deposit of gold , but they are very small ."
neutral,That ’ s right . A few people go panning for gold in rivers .
neutral,You have many trees in your country . That ’ s another natural resources .
neutral,"So , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ?"
neutral,"More and more people like it now . fewer people play table tennis than before . Many people like swimming , because it is fun and keeps you fit ."
neutral,A great deal of people follow rugby in my country .
neutral,I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age .
neutral,The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
neutral,"They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape ."
neutral,"I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher ."
neutral,"It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further ."
neutral,"Hi , Mark , did you catch the game last night ?"
neutral,Yes . So you'd better dress warmly before you go out .
neutral,See you !
neutral,"Coffee , please ."
neutral,"Which do you like better , orange or lemon ?"
neutral,What about going to a movie ?
neutral,"Thank you , Jack.To be frank , I'd rather forget my birthday ."
neutral,Are you going to the beach this saturday afternoon ?
neutral,It depends on the weather .
neutral,You've formed a sound habit .
neutral,"I think so , too ."
neutral,Will you go with us this Sunday ?
neutral,What for ?
neutral,Ann invited us to dinner this saturday afternoon .
neutral,Is Water Shrinking Festival official ?
neutral,That ’ s fine with me . I don ’ t hate vegetables and I don ’ t eat much during lunch .
neutral,Yes .
neutral,I am not picky on food . Just bring me the day menu .
neutral,"I'm no exception , and that's why I spent a whole afternoon in the swimming pool ."
neutral,Manchester United . What about you ?
neutral,I'm going to see the doctor this weekend .
neutral,What's your trouble ?
neutral,There's a concert in Capital Theatre this Sunday .
neutral,So what ?
neutral,To lose some weight .
neutral,You moved to a new place ?
neutral,Ok with me . You are the boss . I will meet you downstairs after work .
neutral,You are right . Our company ’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better . It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking .
neutral,It's fine with me .
neutral,How about seven o'clock ?
neutral,"You mean the one with the yellow bricks ? But last time I saw it , it wasn ’ t really in business yet . I saw some people inside furnishing the rooms . Is it open now ?"
neutral,"Yes , someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when I passed by this morning . So , let ’ s have a try . My treat ."
neutral,Better luck this time !
neutral,The music is on.May I have the pleasure to dance with you ?
neutral,Certainly .
neutral,Do you know about All Fools ' Day ?
neutral,"Please come in , Mr.Jackson ."
neutral,Can we have two tickets for this evening's film ?
neutral,Are these seats all right ? They're in the second rows .
neutral,Do you have seats in the fourth or fifth rows ?
neutral,Thirty yuan .
neutral,I hope we'll get together again soon .
neutral,"Well , what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?"
neutral,"Ok , I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . I am sure they don ’ t want to miss it ."
neutral,Did you remember to bring back that software I lent to you ?
neutral,Would you mind if I make a suggestion ?
neutral,"Of course not , go ahead ."
neutral,"Well , sure it is . Actually , I have been cutting down the amount since two months ago . I used to smoke a pack of cigarettes for a single day . Now I limit it to 6 cigarettes a day ."
neutral,Thank you for your suggestion .
neutral,You ’ re welcome .
neutral,"Oh , certainly.When would you like to come ?"
neutral,I'm told Cold Blood just finished its last cut .
neutral,How much is the ticket ?
neutral,1564 .
neutral,A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
neutral,Why ?
neutral,I think this one will do .
neutral,"They're very good friends , aren't they ?"
neutral,I wouldn't say that.They seem to be on good terms but actually they always speak ill of each other .
neutral,Jane is going to quit her job in the bank .
neutral,I like spring best . It is neither too cold nor too hot . Freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . How about you ?
neutral,"No , thanks ."
neutral,"As far as I'm concerned , staying at home is more comfortable than going to the movies ."
neutral,"What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ?"
neutral,"It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ?"
neutral,"Sure he is . Winter swimming does good to health , I hear ."
neutral,Where would you like to have your dinner ?
neutral,"You won a lottery ? Don ’ t beat around the bush , just tell me , please ."
neutral,"Oh , it's too far to walk there.We can take a bus ."
neutral,I feel confused by all the diet options out there . I don ’ t know which one actually works .
neutral,"Not really , but I know it is very popular a traditional Chinese gambling game ."
neutral,Japanese is easy to learn .
neutral,"I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ?"
neutral,Why not start with the most interesting one ?
neutral,Volunteer in a zoo ? What specific things will you do ?
neutral,"It wasn't that bad , and you're the one that insisted on skipping dinner.We went to an excellent restaurant ."
neutral,"Now you're talking , we can see that love story next time ."
neutral,"Which is your preference , tea or coffee ?"
neutral,Last year when I visited China .
neutral,"You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now ."
neutral,So what ?
neutral,When ?
neutral,After baseball practice .
neutral,I think Andy's party will be fun .
neutral,What's that ?
neutral,Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ?
neutral,You bet . I was supposed to call my mother an hour ago .
neutral,Good question . I have to think about it .
neutral,Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on .
neutral,For What ?
neutral,"Yeah , my wife likes that one , too . Personally , I prefer action movies ."
neutral,Are you in favor of having a trip during the spring break ?
neutral,This is just what I have in mind.Where are you planning to go ?
neutral,Do you need a hand with that ?
neutral,Don't worry about it .
neutral,Do you think Tom will be elected president ?
neutral,"OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night ."
neutral,"It looks best in spring , when the plum and cherry blossoms are out ."
neutral,"Lots of reasons I guess , unemployment is pretty high these days ."
neutral,My brother won a free trip and he's taking me .
neutral,I don't know whether or not to believe him .
neutral,I said you can trust him . You just have to believe it .
neutral,"I want to go camping , you know , just get a way for the weekend . I'm not sure I'll be able to , though ."
neutral,"Well , I have a lot of work . I'll see how to goes ."
neutral,What do you think of shopping ?
neutral,"You are friend of Janet , right ? I am Andrew , Andrew Smith ."
neutral,"Noirin , N-O-I-R-I-N , it's an Irish name ."
neutral,He got a job and now he owns a small grocery in town .
neutral,"No , I am from south California . This is my first real winter ."
neutral,How long have you been in Taiwan ?
neutral,"I am not sure , where exactly is it ?"
neutral,That ' ok . That's happens all the time .
neutral,"About 18 years , I started learning when I was a kid ."
neutral,"If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final ."
neutral,At least 20 days .
neutral,My mother is a professor and my father is a manager .
neutral,"No , usually they're very busy ."
neutral,"Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ?"
neutral,Do you like watching TV ?
neutral,What do you exactly mean by usually ?
neutral,I don't like spending time on commercials.There ' re too many commercials on TV .
neutral,I think we picked the right line . This one seems to be moving more quickly than the others .
neutral,It is just too much . Don ’ t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ?
neutral,"Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ’ s always rush hour.So the buses are always crowded ."
neutral,"Yeah , absolutely !"
neutral,You have been here for how long ? Four months now ?
neutral,"Yeah , about ."
neutral,"I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation ."
neutral,I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time .
neutral,"Oh , that ’ s very kind of you . I am going to the Garden Hotel ."
neutral,"You are married to a foreigner , huh ? So what ’ s it like ?"
neutral,"Yes , it would be my first trip overseas . Actually , it's going to be my first time leaving the country ."
neutral,"No , I have never vacationed anywhere exotic . But even if I don't get a chance to travel on my personal time , at least I can travel on company time !"
neutral,Would you recommend some places for sightseeing ?
neutral,"Maybe so , but it seems kind of strange , which the rest of us in white shirts , dark suites , and ties ."
neutral,"It's not as bad as that ... We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers . Besides , didn't you hear what Brian found on his desk this morning ?"
neutral,"You're right.He ' s a hard worker , easy to get along with , honest , and he never steals the credit on projects.The only thing he's lacking in is experience ."
neutral,Just once.Quite a few years ago we took the kids to Disneyland on our vacation.They had a blast .
neutral,"Well , California ’ s changed over the last little while.You should come back out sometime ."
neutral,Can I get you something to drink ?
neutral,"Did you hear what's going on downtown today ? All the orders from the factory are staging a demonstration in the streets . Not one of the two thousand employees showed up for work today , and they have gathered outside the city hall to demand better working conditions for all factory employees ."
neutral,So what kind of demands do they have ? What are they asking for specifically ?
neutral,"Yes , we'll start with appetizers , follow with a soup and salad course , then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken , and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort ."
neutral,"With your prime rib and chicken choices , you'd better hope nobody's vegetarian ."
neutral,"It's not just about the things that you learn , you know ... seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation . You can learn a few things , but more importantly , you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future . The social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway ."
neutral,"It depends on the topic , the teacher , and the way the course is set up . Yesterday , even though we only had a short time to discuss the issues , the workshop got us all thinking . We learned some very basic , but very useful methods of dealing with personnel issues ."
neutral,I did ... I just hope I can implement all these great ideas that we shared .
neutral,"Well , a lot of the games were pretty silly . I don't know how much it helped us to be a better team , but i think everyone had a good time ."
neutral,"I think that's an important part of it all ... we've got to be able to see another side of our co-workers and boss ... We can see what they're like as real human beings , working together on some project , for fun . I really think it helped our team jell together better ."
neutral,Is it really that simple ? It doesn't seem very efficient to run things that way ...
neutral,"Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there , I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late . He takes the train , remember ?"
neutral,"Oh , that's right . Well , the train shouldn't be late . That means there is only one explanation ... Bill must have overslept ."
neutral,Why doesn't he just drive to work ?
neutral,"No kidding ! When the last CEO left , we were worried about the future of the company ."
neutral,"He is responsible to the board of directors for everything that happens in the company . He or she must give leadership to all company officers , as CEO is also responsible for providing the guidance of philosophy of the company , and acting as official representative , or face of the company ."
neutral,They aren't too familiar with doing business outside of Japan . There are a lot of cultural differences to account for .
neutral,"I'll say ! Sometimes they just do things really differently . But one thing I can say , they are really hospitable ."
neutral,"Don't worry , you'll find a way ."
neutral,Why are you in such a hurry ?
neutral,I should finish it as soon as possible .
neutral,I feel I really stupid .
neutral,"Well , you can just comfort yourself like that ."
neutral,Don't mistake her as somebody . She ' s my older sister .
neutral,"Come on , Tara . Let ’ s go up to the window and buy two tickets . The movie is starting in a few minutes ."
neutral,We can ’ t break into the line . Don ’ t be so impatient . We ’ ll be at the front of the line soon .
neutral,I ’ m looking forward to this film . I read a good review of it in this morning ’ s newspaper .
neutral,"That sounds about right to me , fifty cents a bag . If they think you don ’ t know better , they ’ ll try to get more ."
neutral,"Well , last night I went out with some journalists for a casual party , but I was overdressed . I wore what I consider casual - - an outfit of skirt , blouse , scarf , and medium heels ... you know ."
neutral,"Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking ."
neutral,It wasn't . It was birdseed . We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it .
neutral,Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch .
neutral,"Hi , Cindy . I thought I ’ d missed you ."
neutral,"Oh , I am very sorry , Hans . Thank you for waiting for me . You must have been here a long time already ."
neutral,"I was in a comfortable place , so really , it ’ s no problem . I am happy to see you . Did the rain hold you up long ?"
neutral,You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie .
neutral,"Darling , I have news for you . Bobby and his wife , Evelyn , are going to have a baby soon ."
neutral,"In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese ."
neutral,It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now .
neutral,"So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ?"
neutral,"Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it ."
neutral,Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . Government service can be a rewarding and secure career .
neutral,I ’ Ve always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
neutral,"Sometimes that ’ s true , but not usually . Most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive ."
neutral,"I ’ m a GS - 15 . That ’ s high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage ."
neutral,What ?
neutral,"Huh ? I can ’ t hear you , the music ’ s too loud ."
neutral,Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson .
neutral,Don ’ t worry . You can take night classes . I did that when I had kids . And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . Then you could find a job and work .
neutral,"So , where are you going to spend your winter vacation ?"
neutral,That ’ s true . But we have known each other over the Internet for a few months now . Actually we are on an intimate level . We even plan to be engaged next month .
neutral,Probably you ’ re right .
neutral,"Lili , let ’ s take a vacation !"
neutral,"Where will we sleep , then ?"
neutral,What about other expenses ?
neutral,That sounds boring to me .
neutral,What do you plan on doing after you retire ?
neutral,Wow !
neutral,"Oh , you mean palm reading 5 . I've seen that before , but I don't believe in it ."
neutral,"So , Jack , do you believe in ghosts ?"
neutral,"It was many years ago , when I was a little child . It was the middle of the night , and I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs , when ..."
neutral,So that's where you saw the ghost ? In your house ? What did it look like ? Was it hideous ?
neutral,You mean Mark ? He seems like such an honest guy .
neutral,What'd he do ?
neutral,I told him I would divorce him if he wouldn ’ t tell me the truth or end the relationship with her .
neutral,Good . I totally agree with what you did .
neutral,Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ?
neutral,"Hey , what's new ?"
neutral,"Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ?"
neutral,But we can't have thirteen for dinner !
neutral,I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . It's only a superstition . It really doesn't mean anything .
neutral,Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday !
neutral,But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ?
neutral,That sounds like my Grandmother . She was always stubbornly independent .
neutral,They see their independence as a kind of character strength .
neutral,I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people .
neutral,You mean they ’ re kicking you out ?
neutral,"Well , it ’ s not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it ’ s ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so ."
neutral,"Hey , Sandy , what's new ? Interested in a movie tonight ?"
neutral,"Well , the minister at my church told us about it , and it seemed interesting . I thought I'd try it once , and if I didn't like it I'd stop ."
neutral,"Yeah , it sounds easy . How long does it take ?"
neutral,"Only about two hours , for a couple of days a month . Why don't you give it a try ?"
neutral,"Yes , in many ways it is . There are many stereotypes I have to deal with in my daily life ."
neutral,I see . It looks like there are still a lot of issues we need to work on in the US .
neutral,"Come in and have some coffee , Anna . The kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends ."
neutral,"They spend hours there , especially on weekends ."
neutral,I know several . But wouldn ’ t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
neutral,Isn ’ t that complicated ?
neutral,Sure . I love going to the mall .
neutral,"Hi , Mr . Zhang . What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy . How was your date ?"
neutral,Me ? I ’ m even less experienced than you are .
neutral,"You know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . Because I never exercise ."
neutral,"Hi , my name ’ s Karl . My wife and I are moving in next door ."
neutral,"In summer I go hiking , and in winter I ski ."
neutral,"Yeah , that ’ s the best part . All of my children can get free medical care ."
neutral,"I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin ."
neutral,Can you believe the headlines ?
neutral,What are you reading ?
neutral,"I ’ m reading about Michael Milliken , the Bond King ."
neutral,"Hi , Don . What a surprise !"
neutral,"Oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . What have you been taking ? Are you on a diet ?"
neutral,Dance ? You only go dancing ? That ’ s not hard . I can do that .
neutral,I don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in New York .
neutral,Why ? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live .
neutral,I enjoy watching Channel 5.They always have films from all over the world .
neutral,It's really hard to avoid such bad influence anyway .
neutral,"How are we going there , by bike or by bus ?"
neutral,"By bike , of course.You don't want to miss the beautiful scenery , do you ?"
neutral,I prefer boxing to beef .
neutral,You did ? How do you like the fashion show ?
neutral,I missed it . I watch a live show of a concert .
neutral,My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days .
neutral,Criminals are clever ? They ’ re only successful when people are careless .
neutral,OK .
neutral,Have you ever thought of going to Africa ?
neutral,"No , it might be dangerous there ."
neutral,Are you a wrestler or a boxer ?
neutral,No.Why ?
neutral,"Hey , what's the matter ?"
neutral,There was a concert country music last week .
neutral,I don't think I'm getting better .
neutral,"Believe me , you really look much better than before ."
neutral,"Thank you.That ' s the result of exercise.By the way , do you work out ?"
neutral,"No , but I am starting working out from now on ."
neutral,"Do you remember Tina , my good friend ?"
neutral,But the problem is she and her ex-boyfriend are working in the same department . It is somehow embarrassing for them to see each other everyday .
neutral,It will do you good to go out for entertainment at weekends.What kind of movie do you like best ?
neutral,"It's hard to say , I like interesting and significant ones . I don't care whether they're blockbusters or not ."
neutral,"Yeah , really ."
neutral,"I work for the Bank of China , in the International Section ."
neutral,Good . I was thinking that I ’ d like to invite you to watch a movie . I can meet you at the cinema gate .
neutral,All right.Maybe next time I can go with you.Bye !
neutral,"No , it's the Japanese team ."
neutral,What are the most popular sports in your country ?
neutral,Thank you . I can teach you how to bowl .
neutral,It doesn't seem to be so easy .
neutral,Have you ever been to any other country ?
neutral,"Not yet , what's your opinion ?"
neutral,"Yes , but it's not so appetizing ."
neutral,Certainly .
neutral,That's my cousin Hubert.He likes smiling .
neutral,What's he doing ?
neutral,"From his looks , I'd say he's a man of character ."
neutral,What did you do last vacation ?
neutral,I learned to drive and I got a driving license .
neutral,He's handsome .
neutral,How time flies ! I'll not see twenty again .
neutral,Who's that old lady trimming the trees ?
neutral,All right.Let ' s go .
neutral,Exactly !
neutral,Which team has won ?
neutral,Did you see his last dive ?
neutral,Is your father in the habit of having naps ?
neutral,What do you know about Julia Roberts ?
neutral,I mean her personality .
neutral,"Well , I like others very much , but I really don't think much of this one ."
neutral,A new film is on.Have you ever seen it ?
neutral,What kind of movie is it ?
neutral,It's a feature film .
neutral,I'm sorry for hero . I dont think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts .
neutral,I'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments .
neutral,Going to the cafeteria ?
neutral,"No , I am not eating there anymore . I have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . The food served in the cafeteria is not my type . I am a total meat lover . But the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . They have been serving the Chinese cabbage and white gorse for three days . Haven ’ t you noticed that ?"
neutral,"Well , I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment ."
neutral,Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it .
neutral,It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
neutral,Let ’ s stop gossiping and get back to work .
neutral,"Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices ."
neutral,This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ?
neutral,Sure . Why don ’ t you sit down for a minute ? You haven ’ t taken a rest all morning .
neutral,"Spring Festival is the most important festival in China , isn't it ?"
neutral,"Yes , that's true ."
neutral,"Yes , dumpling is a must.There is also other food.For example , people eat chicken for good luck ."
neutral,"Yes , it's really wonderful !"
neutral,"Well , if you want to ! Seriously , though , let's make a bet ."
neutral,Is there anything worth watching on another channel ?
neutral,I think there ’ s a Western on .
neutral,"Well , I really wanted to see the football game ."
neutral,"I think sound is even more important ! Guns , bombs , sirens--that's what makes a movie exciting !"
neutral,I can't believe it ! I lost .
neutral,I want a rematch . Let's play again .
neutral,"Is your boss named Vic ? Your pager says , This is Vic . Here I come !"
neutral,"Here , see for yourself . That's really strange ! It's almost the same as when I ..."
neutral,"My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s.Easier set than done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date ."
neutral,"You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea ."
neutral,"No , there is an updated version , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes ."
neutral,I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ’ m not knowing who is reading it .
neutral,But they are so silly ! They're not art !
neutral,"Well , we can still do some window shopping , can we ?"
neutral,"Hey , it is ! A lot of people like that movie !"
neutral,"I'm sorry , but it's a bad movie . The plot is stupid , and the script is poorly written ."
neutral,"No , I don't like action movies because I'm cultured !"
neutral,How's your new job going ?
neutral,"Really well , thanks ."
neutral,"She's not bad . She's a bit bossy , but I'm sure I'll get used to her ."
neutral,Do people in different departments get along with each other ?
neutral,Do you like working in teams with people from different departments ?
neutral,Do you like working in teams ?
neutral,I prefer it to working independently . I think most people do .
neutral,I'm in between jobs at the moment .
neutral,what kind of job are you looking for ?
neutral,I'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the IT field .
neutral,"Well , along with Jurassic Park ! Nice going , you got the right answer ."
neutral,"Will you get a pay-raise , too ?"
neutral,My boss .
neutral,Those are good answers . How did she react ?
neutral,I see what you mean . He ’ s really cute . How old is he ?
neutral,You sneak !
neutral,I know . It's a mix of all the latest songs .
neutral,Espresso is made with a machine that forces steam and boiling water through finely ground coffee . It's strong .
neutral,That proves my point ! Protect yourself or you'll get burned .
neutral,Why ? Do you have a robot girlfriend ?
neutral,"Three other people started to bid . One called himself Buddhabuyer , so I knew he meant business . I raised my bid twice , but it kept going up ."
neutral,"If you did , you probably got ripped off ."
neutral,Why ? Are you planning to stir-fry my face ?
neutral,You might make a few enemies this way .
neutral,You're so witty ...
neutral,This watch is supposed to be worn on your left hand .
neutral,Bingo !
neutral,"Be a little more open-minded , Stu ! Don't believe everything you read in your history books !"
neutral,What's that supposed to mean ?
neutral,"Carl won the gold in the 100 , 200 , long jump , and 4x100 relay in 1984 ."
neutral,"Are you ready for the big competition today , Todd ? The winner gets two tickets to the Sydney Olympics !"
neutral,You look like a cooking show host--only messier .
neutral,"No , thank you . I'll take an aspirin and see how it goes ."
neutral,"Yes . In fact , one of the categories is on foreign language films ."
neutral,"Isabelle , you know I'm not interested in fame ."
neutral,"No , she's wearing my Chinese zodiac sign ."
neutral,Are you ready for the camping trip ?
neutral,Let me see ... two books ... birdseed ?
neutral,"You just pop'em in in the morning , take them out at night , and then throw them away . No cleaning !"
neutral,Cool . So are you near-sighted or far-sighted ?
neutral,"I will . You know , as a newcomer , I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere ."
neutral,"You mean the one with the yellow bricks ? But last time I saw it , it wasn ’ t really in business yet . I saw some people inside furnishing the rooms . Is it open now ?"
neutral,For sure all the customers will benefit from this .
neutral,I heard that James was fired because he got a keep back of 20 thousands dollars from a vender .
neutral,That ’ s open secret .
neutral,"Are you doing something on Saturday evening ? If not , welcome to my new apartment ."
neutral,"Oh , is that so ?"
neutral,Exactly .
neutral,I am thinking about resigning from my current job .
neutral,"Yes , I have been thinking about it for quite a while . Now I finally make up my mind to leave . I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday ."
neutral,"Ok , did you find a new company ?"
neutral,"Good for you , but your leaving will be a great loss to us . It is so nice to work with you ."
neutral,Thanks . I had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
neutral,"Thank you for saying so . I don ’ t know , probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues ."
neutral,"That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off ."
neutral,"I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ?"
neutral,"Actually , I ’ m interested in all of them . The more choices we have , the harder to make a decision ."
neutral,Sure it is . This is a changing world . Does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? They are very useful for us .
neutral,What about the environmental factors ?
neutral,I'd better not . Brooke hates the Backstreet Boys !
neutral,"How are you feeling , champ ? Ready to go ?"
neutral,"If it were up to Stanley , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ! He loves to sing ."
neutral,How about this one ?
neutral,"Why do you drink ? I mean , where does drinking get you ?"
neutral,You're always so careless .
neutral,"Sorry , not yet ! can you help me to select the dress ? i don , t what i should wear to fit thinner party ."
neutral,"It is too loud , we ’ ll handle some official business first before the dinner ."
neutral,"Yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . I tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused . I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . Practice makes the master ."
neutral,"So , Monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ?"
neutral,It was around one thirty in the morning . I guess I didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . I just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them .
neutral,"That ’ s normal after a tense work evening . Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . Once , I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later ."
neutral,"But if the company asks , what else can we do ?"
neutral,Have you got any plans for the coming holiday ?
neutral,A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ?
neutral,"Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ?"
neutral,"Well , keep a low profile ."
neutral,How long have you been in this company ?
neutral,Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ?
neutral,"I know girls love this kind of car . Look , it's got a sunroof ! Imagine ... a cool , starry night ..."
neutral,And lots of Dear Abby sob stories ...
neutral,"Nice . Hey , I like the layout of this page ..."
neutral,Are you ready to go shopping ?
neutral,How was your job at the state-owned enterprise ?
neutral,I want to try different things before I find the one I really like .
neutral,"Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three ."
neutral,"Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before ."
neutral,You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first .
neutral,Uh ... that's Greek to me .
neutral,Just dab it all over your face and then take a look at the symbols that appear .
neutral,"So decode this for me , Madame Psycho ."
neutral,I'm waiting ...
neutral,"Well , you have three hearts — lucky in love tonight . Dress up and go on a date !"
neutral,Where did you go to university ?
neutral,What is your current occupation ?
neutral,"Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code ."
neutral,"Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean ."
neutral,"First of all , they have an excellent benefits package for all employees , even the maintenance staff have health and dental coverage ."
neutral,"I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat.oh , there he is ."
neutral,let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...
neutral,Now what are you doing ?
neutral,"I wish our competition will quit poaching our people , when Susan resigned last week to work for the Sunburst , she was our fourth employee to leave us for them ."
neutral,"Have you ever considered that perhaps we have a morale problem among our employees ? If everyone is discontent with their work , of course they won't stick arround ."
neutral,"Our human resource department is working on it , it's not easy to recruit new employees every few month , it's hard to find qualified people ."
neutral,Maybe we should start shopping around the competitors people .
neutral,"Did they finally fill that post , how come I haven't seen her ? She must have not been inducted yet ."
neutral,"If the new girl is competent , maybe they will promote her when that time comes ."
neutral,"Not really , do you ?"
neutral,Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ?
neutral,"Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers ."
neutral,"Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion ."
neutral,Don ’ t you think you are overreacting a little ? Calling you by nicknames shouldn ’ t be so bad ...
neutral,That ’ s what you get for working in a male-dominated field . I think you ’ ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . You probably won ’ t be able to change him .
neutral,Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
neutral,"I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . Also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic ."
neutral,"Sure , it's easy . First of all , the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple . People are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans . Stick to about three or four points , give an overview of the points , then present them one by one , and then summarize at the end . Be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered ."
neutral,"You should consider the size and interests of your audience . In other words , who is listening , and what do they want to hear ... you can put together a PPT with some graphics and animations that will catch people's attention , but be careful not to go overboard ."
neutral,"You know , stage fright is very normal , most people get nervous before they have to speak in front of large groups . Just prepare well , rehearse beforehand , and trust that you will be great ... and you will be !"
neutral,Not bad . It seems you are super yogurt lover . You have so many in your cart .
neutral,Are you watching the soccer match tonight ? It must be the most exciting one in this season .
neutral,"I heard that your previous manager was very capable , he is a good manger ."
neutral,What do you mean ?
neutral,How would you describe your relationship with our boss ?
neutral,"China provides the bulk of our product inventory , for sure . We import more than 40 different items from China . Most of the imports that come out of China are low-grade plastics or toys . Japan produces many electronic exports , Germany produces excellent mechanical exports ."
neutral,"Well , these mediums are still important ... they aren't a thing of the past ... But I think they might be less important now than in the past . The technology age has arrived !"
neutral,"Earning extra income on the Internet is easier than you might think . After I started selling traditional craft items on the Internet last year , I have really been able to make bank doing something I love ."
neutral,That's marketing research ... But what about getting started once you have an idea ?
neutral,"After you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . If you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with ."
neutral,"I think the government needs a radical plan to improve things . The government just talks , but in the long run , nothing is done to improve the economy ."
neutral,The worst part is that the inflation hurts the poor more than the rich . It also leads to more unemployment in the long run . I don't know what a good solution would be to make the economy more vibrant again ...
neutral,But what ?
neutral,I'm sure there'll be canned ! And there also might be some legal consequences .
neutral,Because whoever let the cat out of the bag was breaking client confidentiality .
neutral,I'm sure management is on top of it .
neutral,What changes were made from the old page to the new page ?
neutral,"Don't worry , most of the leads on mildly interested , if not strongly interested . We've just got to make sure the Hot ones are contacted right away . And even the contacts that for what ever reason aren't prepared to make an order now , they might be interested in the future . Please be conscanciouss about getting a hold of everyone of these leads . We've spent a big chunk of marketing budget to find these people . I don't want our investment to go down the drain ."
neutral,The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports .
neutral,"Did you hear the news ? Two of our major suppliers , Murphy Music and U-Tunes are merging ! If they are conglomerated into one company into one company , it would have some serious affects on our market strategy ."
neutral,The competition must have been too stiff for U-Tunes.Otherwise why would they allow themselves to be taken over by their sworn enemy ?
neutral,"Five . Besides my parents and me , there are my brother and sister ."
neutral,He ’ s not quite 25 .
neutral,How often do you write to them ?
neutral,I really should be on my way .
neutral,"Oh , not yet . At least have one for the road ."
neutral,"Well , I am sorry you have to leave so early ."
neutral,Bye .
neutral,Not bad . At least I am still alive .
neutral,I don't want to make a bad impression .
neutral,I'll keep that in mind . Does everything on the desk belong to me ?
neutral,Can I make personal phone calls during my office hours ?
neutral,I've just gotten a pair of pre-sale Star Wars movie tickets from a friend and was thinking of inviting you along for the opening premiere . Are you interested ?
neutral,"Well , let's see . The movie stars at 10 . We should be there at least 1 hour earlier , because there is a big line . I could pick you up at your house at 8 , if that's ok with you ."
neutral,So I'll see you tomorrow then at 8 .
neutral,"It stops snowing , but there's a bit wind ."
neutral,The ice is soon be thick for skating . I'm so fine to want a sport
neutral,"Hi , Helen ! how is it going ?"
neutral,Would you like to go to the cinema with me ?
neutral,I ’ m sorry I can ’ t make it.Thank you anyhow .
neutral,It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ?
neutral,Sure . But it will be a long hike 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ?
neutral,"Oh , good . That's nice to hear . Well , I am going to a football match . I need to go ."
neutral,"Sorry , I don ’ t quite follow you ."
neutral,I am afraid not .
neutral,Would you like to go sightseeing tomorrow ?

neutral,He is known as American's greatest president . Do you know why ? Because he fought against slavery and secession at a time in history where others were too afraid to do anything . He succeeded because of his ambition and generous spirit .
neutral,That's shortsighted . By the time the workers are experienced and contributing . They are likely to go .
neutral,I am worried about my future . I can't believe that our company is as big as it is . The company can only continue to grow by taking care of its staff .
neutral,"Let's take a coffee break , shall we ?"
neutral,What keeps you so busy ? You've been sitting there for hours . You've got to walk around.You just can't stay on the computer forever .

neutral,"I liked him too . He is so cute ! You know , even though I was slightly disappointed , I can't wait for the next episode . I wonder when they ’ re going to start making it and when it ’ s scheduled for release ?"

neutral,I hope not . We are getting closer .. two more ... one more ... it's our turn .

neutral,Thank you . Same to you .
neutral,"I've been invited over to a friend ’ s , and you ?"
neutral,Is she coming ?
neutral,"Yes , they are ."
neutral,"In fact , we are beginning to make preparations ."
neutral,"They could generally be divided into two categories , direct and indirect contaminant sources ."
neutral,"Well , direct ones are the pollution directly from factories , refineries waste treatment plants etc . , aren ’ t they ?"
neutral,You are a lucky man . How about Mr . Smith .
neutral,I don't know . But they say that Mrs . Smith wears the pants in the house .
neutral,You mean she bosses her husband around ?
neutral,But I don't think she really loves him .
neutral,"If I were her , I wouldn't marry a man I don't really love ."
neutral,No . She is really a very nice girl ...
neutral,I know she ’ s head over heels in love with you . She will be badly hurt !

neutral,She has been admitted to Yale with a scholarship .
neutral,"You have a lovely house , Jack ."
neutral,Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately .
neutral,"Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over ."
neutral,Go right ahead .
neutral,"Well , maybe so . But I still think everyone has their rights of their own opinion ."
neutral,Hello !
neutral,"I know it's not good for me , but the problem is I just can't help it ."
neutral,"Well , I've got an idea , put the label cancer sticks on each pack of cigarettes , and read it before you smoke . It may give you a feeling to reduce it ."
neutral,I'll try .
neutral,"You look run down , Brian ."
neutral,Good idea .
neutral,Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned . Maybe I can help you .
neutral,Let's just hope the politicians don't figure out a way to spend it .
neutral,"I see . Then the basic different is , hackers build things , crackers break them ."
neutral,"Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb ."
neutral,"Hey , let's eat out tonight ."
neutral,Aren ’ t you going to swim ?
neutral,All right . Suit yourself . I am going swimming .
neutral,I've got a better idea . Why don ’ t we hire a boat and go for a ride ? What do you think ?
neutral,How many members were in your party in all ?
neutral,I hope it's not gonna break into three digits
neutral,But it's already awfully close .
neutral,"That's fine with me , but we'll have to get there early . Because after 8 pm , there is always a long line ."
neutral,What did the whetherman say ?
neutral,I hope it stays like this .
neutral,It's pretty cold and it often snows .
neutral,"Yes , especially in spring ."
neutral,"Once , when I was a child ."
neutral,"Oh , it's time for the weather reporter . Let's turn on the TV ."
neutral,My car didn't want to start either at first .
neutral,And the streets are covered with snow .
neutral,Do you know what the temperature is today ?
neutral,You ’ re darn right . I am out of style . So what What's the point of keeping yourself in style
neutral,But what would other people think ?
neutral,Most of them are from America and Europe .
neutral,Which hotel are they staying at ?
neutral,"Then , Do you know her younger sister ?"
neutral,You mean Mary ?
neutral,"What ’ s wrong with you , Mr . Polly ?"
neutral,"It ’ s a problem , because my boss is in that shop now ."
neutral,"Ok , I will go there myself ."
neutral,That ’ s right . I ’ Ve never really liked it since I got here .
neutral,No .
neutral,But we ’ re so right for each other .
neutral,"Actually , I'm not good at tennis at all ..."
neutral,"Oh , come on . That's no reason to do something you're not interested in ."
neutral,Not me . I'd like to be a bachelor forever .
neutral,Well ! I guess people don ’ t find him so peculiar anymore .
neutral,What ’ s on TV tonight ?
neutral,"Not much , that new reality-TV show , Ally McNeal , oooo , Dark Angel ."
neutral,"Oh , come on . That ’ s such a girl ’ s show ."
neutral,No it ’ s not . It ’ s just funny .
neutral,Like what ?
neutral,I ’ m so jealous .
neutral,"I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish ."
neutral,Do you think of television though as a great time-waster ?
neutral,"Aha , but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get . . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things ... best programmes that ... that undoubtedly are on television ?"
neutral,"To be honest , it looks like your old carpet . Is it really new or did you just have your old cleaned ?"
neutral,How many cigarettes do you smoke a day ?
neutral,"No , I ’ m not . My father smoked two packs a day for forty years ."
neutral,"When the rain stops , you ’ ll see how beautiful the beach is ."
neutral,But the rain has been pouring down for two days . We ’ Ve both caught colds .
neutral,"It ’ s broken . I just bought it yesterday , you know , it costs me $ 556 ."
neutral,Mike suggests me to return it .
neutral,I am going to the mountains with my family this weekend .
neutral,That sounds like fun .
neutral,Don't worry . I've got money . It's my treat .
neutral,It's easy . All you have to do is to use your pieces to surround the opponent's pieces and then take over all of his territory .
neutral,"Total Fitness , why ?"
neutral,"Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates ."
neutral,What position do you play ?
neutral,"That's what I'm wondering , too ."
neutral,I haven't decided yet .
neutral,"Oh , they're fine , still very active and enjoying their retirement ."
neutral,Business couldn't be better .
neutral,I can play the piano a bit .
neutral,And all of the flowers are in bloom .
neutral,Who do you think will win the championship ?
neutral,I really can't say . Both teams this year seem really good .
neutral,There's a game on tonight . You want to watch it with me ?
neutral,Would you like to drink some coffee ?
neutral,Would you like to try some watermelon juice ? It tastes good .
neutral,All right
neutral,"After five days ' hard work , I'm surely going to have some fun ."
neutral,"Hey , how was the show ?"
neutral,It's awfully quiet around here .
neutral,Yeah . There's nobody in sight .
neutral,That's a great idea . Let's go to a Chinese restaurant .
neutral,No . I'm tired and I've got to work tomorrow .
neutral,I don't blame you for getting some rest .
neutral,Of course we have . It's on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month .
neutral,"No , not really ."
neutral,"Yeah , that makes sense ."
neutral,I won't ever forget it ! I was sitting in the cafeteria all by myself ...
neutral,"Ok , I guess it's worthy of two yuan ."
neutral,Do you do morning exercises ?
neutral,Have you seen the news that there is a serious flood in the South ?
neutral,Yes . I've got to cancel my traveling plan .
neutral,"Yes , lots of time . I was quite impressed by the wide variety of exhibitions they have ."
neutral,"I should say , it stunned me . I can't imagine what they will think of next ."
neutral,I can't decide what I should do .
neutral,"It all depends . If it's rock music I'll do disco , and if it's romantic music I'll do ballet ."
neutral,Okay . Loser has to take out the trash for a month .
neutral,Keep it . I'm buying tonight .
neutral,I just heard through the grapevine something about you landing a job with some travel agency down town . You can still fill me in on tile details .
neutral,"Sure , I think I know the place ."
neutral,And milk or orange juice ?
neutral,Banana of course .
neutral,Then which will be your first choice ?
neutral,I don ’ t know . How about you ? are you staying here or somewhere .
neutral,My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .
neutral,"Yes , I have . But I have to wait ."
neutral,"People say that you never have a real winter in the South China , but I don't think so ."
neutral,What do you mean ?
neutral,Take my word for it .
neutral,Have you run into your cousin Jimmy lately ?
neutral,"I think so , too ."
neutral,Our team just scored a goal .
neutral,Tell me about it .
neutral,"Yes , I have . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over ."
neutral,Don't worry . It's safe .
neutral,David took me to it last week . I thought it was a little sick .
neutral,Hmm . I'm afraid I can't make it on Monday . I've got to fly to Chicago on business .
neutral,"Well , I'm afraid Thursday is out for me . I'm expected to attend a meeting of our personnel committee , and it's very important for me to be there ."
neutral,Still clipping coupons ?
neutral,Much better than mine .
neutral,"Oh , I don't think I will buy a used sofa even it looks so attractive ."
neutral,One less car on the road means less pollution .
neutral,How far is it ?
neutral,True . How much did you pay ?
neutral,"Well , sometimes , I think it ’ ll be nice to drive to work instead . We ’ ll see . Want to go for a ride ?"
neutral,Come on .
neutral,Not too good yet . Better than I was though .
neutral,"Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ?"
neutral,Couldn ’ t be better . And you ?
neutral,Yep ! Are you going to the rock concert Friday night ?
neutral,"Well , we ’ Ve already done our part ."
neutral,"Yeah , it ’ s your turn to drive next week . Don ’ t be late picking me up ."
neutral,But it was not at all so fine yesterday .
neutral,Maybe not . Dust is no longer a big problem in Beijing .
neutral,I see . The fall in Beijing is really beautiful .
neutral,Then what about spring ?
neutral,I like it so far . But my English still needs work .
neutral,I want to study Mandarin and public relations .
neutral,"Hey , there ’ s Leo . I wonder why he ’ s walking arm in arm with that young woman ."
neutral,That ’ s great . Where did you stay ?
neutral,Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ?
neutral,It looks like you could use it . Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again .
neutral,What ?
neutral,nothing
neutral,But you ’ re crazy about him ?
neutral,I don ’ t actually know him .
neutral,"Not for me , Dick ."
neutral,You mean the kind of stuff like Nirvana ?
neutral,Yes I am . And you ...
neutral,"Okay , let's sit over there ."
neutral,Er ... I'd like to know what time it is now .
neutral,"Oh , Let me see ... It's three forty-five . Er ... wait , My watch is five minutes fast . So it should be three forty"
neutral,"Thank you . By the way , what day is today ?"
neutral,"Yes , I've just come from the States , yesterday in fact . I'm still a bit confused about the time ."
neutral,"Welcome to Beijing . This is my business card . I'm an engineer . If you need any help in Beijing , just give me a call ."
neutral,My grand grandfather was a merchant who ran a small business . He couldn't afford to send my grand father to school .
neutral,So he became a self-taught man ?
neutral,What day is that ?
neutral,"Yes , sure . What time will the wedding begin ?"
neutral,What are you going to wear ?
neutral,How did it happen ?
neutral,"When I come late , there ’ s usually nothing left ."
neutral,"And would you like salad ? The salad plate today is lettuce , tomatoes , and black olives ."
neutral,May I ask where you live ?
neutral,"Just two blocks away , in that tall building ."
neutral,"Are you going to your office now , Miss Chen ?"
neutral,She ’ s a librarian at the public library .
neutral,Larry drives a truck . He drives all over the country . We hardly ever seen him .
neutral,"And does Rocky drive a truck , too ?"
neutral,You ’ re right . I wasn ’ t . I hear nothing .
neutral,"You and Patricia got engaged , didn ’ t you ? You can tell me ."
neutral,"Well , tell me . How was the labor and delivery ?"
neutral,I can't believe the boss was absent from today's meeting .
neutral,I don ’ t think I can get up enough nerve to do this .
neutral,Labor is an abundant resource here .
neutral,"One of many abundant resources , I'd like to point out ."
neutral,"Yes , it's great for cleaning up spills ."
neutral,You mean this is going to be a regular thing ?
neutral,"Oh , give me a break ! That place is too lavish for us ."
neutral,Easy . It ’ s on me .
neutral,"In that case , I ’ m right behind you ."
neutral,Oh shame ! I have a class tomorrow .
neutral,"So you ’ Ve got something on your mind , I guess ."
neutral,"Well , you know what , don ’ t do it , ‘ cause the minute you do , they lose all respect for you ."
neutral,Out of hand .
neutral,Excuse me ?
neutral,Who ’ s that boy ?
neutral,"Oh , Parker with a P ?"
neutral,Barker ? With a B . Of course .
neutral,"Won ’ t you come in , Mr . Barker ?"
neutral,"No , she is an English teacher ."
neutral,You mean the man wearing jeans ? He ’ s her little brother .
neutral,I went back for it . But it was already gone .
neutral,OK . Let ’ s invite all their little friends to come and celebrate .
neutral,"Hi , Bill ."
neutral,"Yes , Doctor William said that he could come back to work ASAP ."
neutral,I'm not really accustomed to the style of the new boss .
neutral,It'll take us all some time to get used to the change .
neutral,"If the weatherman's predictions are accurate , it should rain tomorrow ."
neutral,I will be back again next Wednesday .
neutral,I hope to see you at that time again . Bye .
neutral,Do you think I should buy this now and bring it with us ?
neutral,What kind of gas does this car take ?
neutral,Sure . Any time .
neutral,We have to pick up Conrad before the party .
neutral,We're supposed to meet him at Cal's Bar at 10
neutral,But it's just a bar . There's no danger.You shouldn't be so homophobic .
neutral,"No , I don't . But I never went into a gay bar before ."
neutral,You're late .
neutral,"I know I'm late . I'm sorry . I tried to call you to tell you , but your phone seems to be disconnected ."
neutral,Yes . An automatic message says your phone is not in service .
neutral,But this is terrible . I'm expecting important calls .
neutral,Do you have a cell phone ?
neutral,No . I hate cell phones.But you could go to a neighbor's house and use their phone .
neutral,"Yes , I do.At Ann's house I will call the phone company and have them check my line.If they can fix it right away without coming to my house , then we'll just return here.But if not , I need to wait at Ann's house to talk with the theater guild.It ' s very important to me ."
neutral,"You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . Now excuse me , I have a protest rally to organize !"
neutral,Bill . Bill ! You gotta help me !
neutral,"That ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! You can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! Especially with clothes or jewelry . On top of that , I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like !"
neutral,"So , what are you saying ? You ’ re breaking up with me because I ’ m perfect ?"
neutral,"Baby , come on . Don ’ t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ’ t leave me ."
neutral,"I can ’ t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ’ m only doing this for you . I don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do ."
neutral,"Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ?"
neutral,Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup .
neutral,What was that ?
neutral,"Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty.My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement - I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally ."
neutral,"Fine , but I ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me ."
neutral,"Actually , could I have some milk with that ?"
neutral,"I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready ."
neutral,"You do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you ."
neutral,I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
neutral,"It's a lovely day out today , isn't it ?"
neutral,"You might want to change your plans . With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery ."
neutral,I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
neutral,"If that happens , then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies ."
neutral,"Hi , charlie , are you busy this evening ?"
neutral,What are you doing ?
neutral,I was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
neutral,Sounds like this weekend just isn't going to work out for us .
neutral,Sounds that way . Maybe some other time then ?
neutral,"Yeah , me , too . It's about time I made a move ."
neutral,"How long have you been in to pop music , then ?"
neutral,I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ?
neutral,Do you still play piano ?
neutral,"Yes , it's one of my hobbies ."
neutral,"I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts , so it might be interesting . I read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed ."
neutral,"some people have satellite and cable tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their tv programmes . Besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programmes ."
neutral,"It ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . I play the part of the detective . He has to catch the killer , but there ’ s very little evidence . It ’ s a psychological th"
neutral,I have had disagreement with every director . I ’ Ve worked with . We ’ Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . It was the same when I made this movie . I don ’ t no
neutral,Critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ Ve made recently . Does that bother you ?
neutral,Where are you from ?
neutral,Did your house ever get damaged from the winds ?
neutral,"Wow , that must have really been scary ."
neutral,"Actually , some of my fon best memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass ."
neutral,"No , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . It actually happened the day after he bought the car !"
neutral,did they take his license away ?
neutral,"no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now ."
neutral,Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ?
neutral,"I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i"
neutral,"First , I ’ Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story ."
neutral,That ’ s correct . It ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case .
neutral,How do you research your books ?
neutral,"I think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . You ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said . If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly , it"
neutral,"You ’ re a big fan of Andy Lau , aren ’ t you ?"
neutral,"I was , but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet , so I ’ m not a member now ."
neutral,"I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ’ re famous , so everyone loves them ."
neutral,I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films .
neutral,What is it ?
neutral,"Well , you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader , right ?"
neutral,Are you looking forward to doing more editing work ?
neutral,"Me , too . Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ?"
neutral,Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ?
neutral,"What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ?"
neutral,"I ’ m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey , where many historic figures are buried , like Isaac Newton , the great mathematician and Winston Churchill , the great wartime leader ."
neutral,There ’ s a lot to see there . Perhaps we should go tomorrow .
neutral,"Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ?"
neutral,"I liked it . I didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion ."
neutral,I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic . He doesn ’ t seem to like anything . Which kinds of paintings do you prefer ?
neutral,"Yes , I do . I like painters who use rather than watercolors . The colors appear richer . What do you think ?"
neutral,"Yes . Good artwork is very expensive nowadays . When I was in china , I bought some calligraphy by famous artists . You should come and see it sometime ."
neutral,"I know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money , I think brilliant items are usually higher quality than ~ grounds ."
neutral,"I do for shower items like shower gel and shampoo , but I don't for higher-end items ."
neutral,Do you have any plans for tomorrow night ?
neutral,Not really . I wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . Do you want to go with me ?
neutral,Have you heard of Hot Fuzz ?
neutral,"Yeah , I suppose you wouldn't want to see that , huh ?"
neutral,It depends on who the film is about . Which movie did you have in mind ?
neutral,"That's the Return of the King , right ?"
neutral,"Yeah . Even though the customs were brilliant , I didn't think it was as good as the first two . What did you think ?"
neutral,"I thought the special effects were amazing , but I got a bit confused . The plot was too complicated for me ."
neutral,So how many people are coming for the dinner tonight ?
neutral,There's just going to be 6 of us tonight .
neutral,How do you find studying a language on the internet ?
neutral,I bet you find the character difficult to write !
neutral,"Let ’ s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples !"
neutral,"I ’ m afraid we ’ re in for a rough weekend , Mary . There is a storm system moving through the East Coast . It will be drizzling all day today , and there ’ s a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this eve"
neutral,"Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ’ t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be"
neutral,"I ’ m hungry , let ’ s grab a bite to eat ."
neutral,Sure ! How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches ?
neutral,"All you ever do is have unhealthy fast food Pizza , fries , burgers and hot dogs ! You have to start eating better !"
neutral,"Hey Lydia , what are you reading ?"
neutral,"It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ?"
neutral,Mumm . no .
neutral,"One last thing , I ’ Ve decided to come out of the closet ."
neutral,"Nice day today , isn't it ?"
neutral,I hope it will stay fine tomorrow . I'm going to have a picnic with my family .
neutral,"You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some"
neutral,You need a babysitter .
neutral,I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .
neutral,"Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?"
neutral,I don't know .
neutral,I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .
neutral,"No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a "" tornado watch . "" That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado ."
neutral,"And the second stage is called a "" tornado warning "" ."
neutral,It's scary .
neutral,"Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement ."
neutral,"But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ?"
neutral,"No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them ."
neutral,"OK , that ’ s fine . Bye ."
neutral,"Well , I can help you pack . We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP ."
neutral,"Well , let me know if there ’ s anything I can do to help out ."
neutral,You can always spot the newbies . I can give you a few pointers if you want . Were you trying to use this machine here ?
neutral,"Well , I don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio ."
neutral,It ’ s not that much . Just watch ... I ’ m ok ...
neutral,This is the good life ! We have it good don ’ t you think ?
neutral,"Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what could have been ?"
neutral,"I see . Yeah now that I think of it , I wouldn ’ t have gotten married if I hadn ’ t moved to this town and met Sally ."
neutral,"I understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . If so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala ."
neutral,"You can ’ t compare apples and oranges . I believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching ."
neutral,"As long as you don ’ t treat it better than your wife , it ’ s fine ."
neutral,"Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally ."
neutral,What about all these other pieces ?
neutral,And these two ? They are husband and wife ?
neutral,Nah ! This is boring ! I ’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation !
neutral,"I wanted to , but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block ! I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place ."
neutral,"Gravy ! Jim is such a jive turkey man . He is always hitting me up for cash . Anyway , you wanna book and go grab some grub ?"
neutral,"Yeah man , I ’ m starving !"
neutral,"Sure , honey , we ’ re talking now , aren ’ t we ?"
neutral,"Look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ Ve had our laughs , but I don ’ t appreciate ... maybe it ’ s just time we ..."
neutral,"You have always been so soft , Dave !"
neutral,Don ’ t get me wrong ! It ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas !
neutral,Uh ... yeah .. of course !
neutral,"The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen !"
neutral,"Jennifer , there ’ s something I wanna ask you ."
neutral,Welcome . My name is Johnson .
neutral,Nice to meet you .
neutral,"No . Not that . I mean a training card.The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine.Here , let me show you ."
neutral,I see . So this card helps me to keep track of my progress .
neutral,"Yes . And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine.Today , I will go through the machines with you one by one . I will show you how to use them.And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you ."
neutral,Alright . Great .
neutral,I'm sorry . I know there are still seven machines . But I'm exhausted .
neutral,That's okay . Don't worry.It ' s important not to push yourself . Especially not at the beginning .
neutral,"We can just go through them next time . It's no problem . Really.The most important thing is to know your limits.So if you feel burned out now , it is good to stop.Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back , then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks . Right ?"
neutral,"Were you so wild when you were still in Taipei , Sharon ?"
neutral,They're smoking pot . Don't worry about it .
neutral,"Don't worry about it . It is true that pot is illegal in America.But the laws aren't as strict as in Taiwan.If people are arrested , and they have a little pot in their possession , they don't go to jail . They just have to pay a fine ."
neutral,I don't know if I can drink more . I already had two drinks .
neutral,"It is . We study hard all week.And then , on the weekend , we party hard . That's the best way to live ."
neutral,Why don't you run outside ?
neutral,You ?
neutral,"No , not at all . I was on the swimming team in high school.And I'd like to do some weight training . They have decent equipment at that gym ."
neutral,So I need to do something too .
neutral,But lifting weights isn't the best thing.You should do some kind of aerobic exercise .
neutral,Don't worry . You don't have to do anything.All you have to do is listen . You will enjoy it .
neutral,Really ?
neutral,And will I go up to the front to have the bread and wine ?
neutral,Eu-char-ist ? What is that ?
neutral,It doesn't sound like an English word .
neutral,"Karen , do you have a minute ? I'd like to ask you about something ."
neutral,"I think you can give me some advice.You have worked here longer , and I just want to know what you think ."
neutral,I am worried about the meeting this morning .
neutral,"Rude ? You weren't rude at all , Annie . Why do you think you were rude ?"
neutral,I understand . But really you weren't rude at all.You said what you thought . I think he appreciates that .
neutral,"But I am new here , and I'm not sure he is used to that ."
neutral,Do you mind if I put my jacket there ?
neutral,"Well , there are many Chinese Americans , you know.And your English is very good . You sound like an American ."
neutral,"He's still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge , or whether he wants to hire an American.But even if he hires an American , I'll probably be transferred to our American office ."
neutral,You seem excited about it .
neutral,"It takes some time.Because even if the quality is high , people won't accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name.Name recognition is crucial ."
neutral,"Wait , Jimmy , it ’ s cold outside . Put a hat on !"
neutral,"There are some things I miss . But I love Chinese food.And I think the people in Taiwan are really hospitable.Besides , I grew up in Los Angeles , so I'm used to living in crowded places.Why are you going to America ?"
neutral,I'm going to New York to visit my sister . She is in art school . I've never been to New York before . I'm kind of scared .
neutral,Why ?
neutral,"Don't worry about it.Your sister lives there . She probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go.It ' s true there are some dangerous places in big American cities.But if your sister lives there , she must know the city pretty well already ."
neutral,The museums are excellent . And the shopping ! Well ! I'm sure you'll spend a lot of money there .
neutral,And that ?
neutral,Why ?
neutral,We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .
neutral,"Yeah , yeah , whatever ."
neutral,What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family !
neutral,"You ’ re right . I ’ m being crazy ! Ok , I ’ m ready , let ’ s do this !"
neutral,Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you .
neutral,What are you talking about ? Where is your Halloween spirit ? Didn ’ t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ?
neutral,"You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football ."
neutral,Is he ok ?
neutral,What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ?
neutral,What are you so excited about ?
neutral,This is a really great place to watch a baseball game .
neutral,Who are those guys ?
neutral,"Wow , Michael Jordan ’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch ."
neutral,What ’ s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ?
neutral,Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it .
neutral,"Hi , John , how was your vacation ?"
neutral,Sure ! Let ’ s have some nachos and mozzarella sticks .
neutral,Wait ... What !
neutral,"Yeah , I ’ m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains ."
neutral,"Oh , do you go hiking often ?"
neutral,It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ?
neutral,"The ref calls the players for the kick off , and here we go ! Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield , but , oath , it ’ s out of bounds ."
neutral,"Just hold me ... I ’ ll always be here for you , no matter what . And together , we can tackle whatever life throws at us . I believe in us , steven ."
neutral,"Hello everyone ! I ’ m Rick Fields , and here with me is Bob Copeland ."
neutral,Would you travel around the world if you had the money ?
neutral,At the drop of a hat .
neutral,Nothing . He's just got a chip on the shoulder .
neutral,Do you think you will ever work at that company again ?
neutral,That was a tough question . How did you get it right ?
neutral,All of my friends are going out to the lake tonight and I'm going too !
neutral,How was your business trip ?
neutral,"Not at all , I was totally in the dark ."
neutral,"Yes , of course . Didn't you know that ?"
neutral,"That's why a lot of people buy cigarettes here too , isn't it ?"
neutral,"Yes , but you have to calculate a little.You paid fifty dollars and you fell down fifty times.So you only spent one dollar per fall . That's cheap ."
neutral,I saw yesterday that they rent windsurfers at the beach . I want to rent one .
neutral,"No , I'm not.Hey , look at that guy over there ."
neutral,Why not ?
neutral,Of course I'm right . I already told you the rule for Las Vegas . Remember ?
neutral,Okay .
neutral,So how much do you want to gamble ?
neutral,Maybe 500 dollars .
neutral,Now I understand . But I don't smoke or drink.So what am I supposed to buy in here ?
neutral,What ? You feel sorry for the butterflies ?
neutral,"Well , I agree with you . I'd rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains . I just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population ."
neutral,This one is 2300 dollars.Maybe I should buy it for my mother . What do you think ?
neutral,"Yes , but she would like this a lot . She likes to collect little things like this ."
neutral,Why not fifty or one-hundred dollars ?
neutral,"Slot machines ? No , I don't want that ! That's too boring . I want a game with cards or dice ."
neutral,So what do you want to play then ?
neutral,"But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes ."
neutral,do you hear something ?
neutral,Why did she do that ?
neutral,He sounds hot ! What does he do for a living ?
neutral,"Son , firecrackers aren ’ t toys.they ’ re dangerous !"
neutral,Did you see that ? He traveled and the ref didn ’ t call it !
neutral,Yeah well it ’ s about time ! He ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years !
neutral,"Oh , wait a second , you seem really familiar , I think I know you from somewhere ."
neutral,What do you want to do tomorrow night ?
neutral,It's Friday . We should go party .
neutral,Okay . Stay home Sunday . But Friday we should go out dancing .
neutral,Do you feel like dancing ?
neutral,"Yes . You have to teach me the samba , and the tango , and whatever else they do ."
neutral,Maybe .
neutral,Nick ! How ’ s it going ?
neutral,"Yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . You know , I'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion ."
neutral,"You know what , this is really embarrassing , but your name has just slipped my mind . Can you remind me ?"
neutral,"Sure , my name is Ana Ferris . Don ’ t worry about it . it happens to me all the time . I ’ m terrible with names too ."
neutral,Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school .
neutral,Hmm . That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . Don't they ever relax ?
neutral,"Of course they do.You know , Eliza , before I went over there I thought the same thing . I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much.But now that I've worked there , and taught them , I feel it is a good thing.Their parents are very concerned about their education . More than American parents are . And that is good . American kids don't study enough ."
neutral,"As an English teacher , I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . I tried to have a good time with my classes . The students often enjoyed it.And if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . So it was a good experience ."
neutral,Hmm . I know you taught in Costa Rica also.Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan ?
neutral,I've heard about Enrail passes.So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot .
neutral,I agree . And probably the automobile companies are too powerful.They never allowed the government to develop trains .
neutral,Maybe you're right . They will have to develop alternative transportation.But it will be hard in America . Too many people are used to cars.Even in our movies cars are very important .
neutral,Do you want me to give you a ride ?
neutral,Maybe it's just a blessing in disguise . I've been wanting to try a new place anyway .
neutral,There has been talk at school about canceling the concert .
neutral,Does it bother you that your husband goes away on long business trips ?
neutral,No.The time we have spent apart has been good for us.Absence makes the heart grow fonder .
neutral,"I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities ."
neutral,It would be very hard work . Are you sure ?
neutral,Running a farm would be totally different to you current job .
neutral,What about restaurants and entertainment ?
neutral,Is your city a historical place ?
neutral,"As the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby ."
neutral,"I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up ."
neutral,I think there must be .
neutral,"There's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon ."
neutral,"it's not about pay raise or promotion . You know , I hate getting up early in the morning and coming back home late at night ."
neutral,"Yes . but the husband had to work overtime three times a week , so he was always tired ."
neutral,"Yes , but not two every night . Anyway , the strain was too much for him . He had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital ."
neutral,Somewhere new . It's a great place to pick up chicks .
neutral,"Need a new . girlfriend , huh ?"
neutral,"Oh , oh , that tears it ! I'm getting out of here ."
neutral,I've fallen in love with my boss .
neutral,then what's your problem ?
neutral,office romance is very tricky .
neutral,I don't feel like drinking tonight . I'm gonna hang out at YY's .
neutral,"YY's ? That place is boring . How about Xara's ? It's real classy , and they keep the place spin and span ."
neutral,"Yeah , but it's expensive . Nah , I'm going to YY's ."
neutral,"Wow , they really went to town on this place !"
neutral,how's it going ?
neutral,there's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around .
neutral,"almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive ."
neutral,"yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet ."
neutral,"how are you doing , Christopher ?"
neutral,are you doing anything this weekend ?
neutral,that'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ?
neutral,what should I bring with me ?
neutral,I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ?
neutral,"you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money ."
neutral,have you ever been to Disneyworld ?
neutral,"when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ?"
neutral,"well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon ."
neutral,thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?
neutral,thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight .
neutral,Jack and Mary broke up .
neutral,it ’ s so sad . They had been together for only two months . Do you know what the matter was ?
neutral,do you have a car ?
neutral,you could try . It would save you a lot of money .
neutral,"that's true . Every month , I spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs ."
neutral,let's go to a car dealership . I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .
neutral,"yes , I mean it ."
neutral,"no , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working ."
neutral,I ’ m sorry .
neutral,then why didn ’ t you talk to me ?
neutral,shall we keep Our friendship ?
neutral,"sure , let ’ s just be friends ."
neutral,yeah . We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners .
neutral,definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce .
neutral,that's true.Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon .
neutral,what are you listening to ? Is that Beethoven or Mozart ?
neutral,"to be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me ."
neutral,"how long have you been in to pop music , then ?"
neutral,who else is going to be there ?
neutral,what time is it going to start ?
neutral,just over three weeks . Would you like a drink ?
neutral,"sure , what do you have ?"
neutral,so how many people are coming for the dinner tonight ?
neutral,"oh , I thought there were going to be eight . who isn't coming ?"
neutral,excuse me while I go and get that .
neutral,sure thing . What are your plans for the evening ?
neutral,how's it going ?
neutral,what do you think would make you happier ?
neutral,"in the long run , I think breaking up with him would make me much happier , but I know that I'll be depressed about it for a few weeks first ."
neutral,relationships can be confusing sometimes .
neutral,what would you do if you were me ?
neutral,that'd be great . What kind of camera do you have ?
neutral,"yes , I was planning on going . Are you ?"
neutral,sounds great . see you then .
neutral,why are you in such a good mood today ?
neutral,I didn't know you were scared of heights ! Was it really bad ?
neutral,so what did you do about it yesterday ?
neutral,so have you cured your fear of heights ?
neutral,"I think so . After I jumped out of the plane , I realized that I should just enjoy life . Worrying about it or not doing things out of fear is just plain silly ."
neutral,it sounds like you just need to be more careful .
neutral,I'll let you know . Did you want to watch some TV ?
neutral,"I swear , the overhead compartments on these planes just keep getting smaller and smaller !"
neutral,that's so true . thanks for your help . Are you in the aisle seat in this row ?
neutral,I'm in the middle seat .
neutral,"I prefer the British paper , but I'll read whatever one you aren't going to read right away ."
neutral,I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy .
neutral,it is unusually warm . I blame it on global warming .
neutral,"I am from Texas . I was in China once , but it was a long time ago ."
neutral,"Yeah , too cool . How much did they sold you for ?"
neutral,"Jump in , I'll give you a ride ."
neutral,"I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails ."
neutral,You can ! With a little practice .
neutral,Exercised over and over . Exercise is a key .
neutral,"Ahahah , Maybe that will help you lose weight ."
neutral,"This is no laughing matter , Nick ."
neutral,Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ?
neutral,"It works if you keep at it . Come on , let's go !"
neutral,So how long has he here for ?
neutral,"Well , I know you do the right thing ."
neutral,"good morning , Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ?"
neutral,I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday .
neutral,try not to take on more than you can handle .
neutral,"yes , my brothe and I are going . We just finished making our itinerary ."
neutral,"then make sure that you book me a room , too ."
neutral,and check whether they accept credit cards .
neutral,you're a good student . I'm sure you can do well . What you need to do is to relax .
neutral,"well , my friends and I are planning on going to Shangri-La on Saturday . Do you want to come with us ?"
neutral,"there is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes ."
neutral,"we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning ."
neutral,"yeah , I think so ."
neutral,not much . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .
neutral,good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ?
neutral,"I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour ."
neutral,I believe most of them think of it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known .
neutral,and then ?
neutral,"without traffic , it takes about an hour ."
neutral,"yes , I think so . It doesn ’ t close until 5 o ’ clock . You still have plenty of time ."
neutral,is she American ?
neutral,"so I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ?"
neutral,"that's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ?"
neutral,did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower ?
neutral,"yes , that was the first thing we did . We went all the way to the top . There were visitors from all over the world taking photos there ."
neutral,"yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of traveling in the city , I felt sick . I think I had something bad to eat , but it passed by the evening ."
neutral,"yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful ."
neutral,"yeah , that's nice ."
neutral,I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble .
neutral,who are you writing a letter to ?
neutral,I'm just responding to Sue's letter . Do you want to help ?
neutral,"well , maybe you could tell them about my promotion ."
neutral,just today . I guess I forgot to mention it .
neutral,shouldn't we finish writing this letter first ?
neutral,we do balance each other out well . I guess we were really made for each other !
neutral,"I'd like to . It's a cell phone , camera , PAD and mp3 player all in one ."
neutral,I think it's either one or two gigs . I can't remember .
neutral,not much at all . I think it's about 100 dollars .
neutral,"I got one for my birthday when they first came out , but after the battery died out , I never brought another one ."
neutral,"yes , that is an option ."
neutral,how about night vision ? Can you use it in the dark ?
neutral,what's up ?
neutral,not much . I'm just trying to hook up to the internet . I'm having a few problems though .
neutral,what's wrong ?
neutral,"actually , I've got a wireless connection ."
neutral,do you like ever chat online ?
neutral,"No , but I'd like to . Do you have to pay to do instant messaging ?"
neutral,cool . We can meet up in a chat room sometime or just chat online using messenger.thanks for your help .
neutral,"no , I thought I'd wait until you got home ."
neutral,"go on , read it out loud ."
neutral,didn't I tell you ? We're going to Shanghai to stay with them in June .
neutral,"yes , it's got wireless Internet access ."
neutral,sure . Here you go .
neutral,it quit working last week and I haven't had a chance to buy a new one yet .
neutral,how have you been living without a cell phone for a week ? hasn't it been driving you carry being without a phone ?
neutral,how did you figure out how to slove the Rubik's cube ?
neutral,"do you remember , years ago , when everybody at the New Year's party had yo-yos ?"
neutral,I could never figure out how to use my yo-yo .
neutral,let's get started with this game then .
neutral,"if I get the promotion , I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer ."
neutral,"whenever you are given added responsibilities , you should get a promotion ."
neutral,that makes sense . Who interviewed you ?
neutral,I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally .
neutral,those are good answers . How did she react ?
neutral,"she told me that even when I become a senior engineer , I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team ."
neutral,she's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .
neutral,"that's quite a bit . If I give you a raise , I'm going to have to give everyone a raise ."
neutral,"if that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?"
neutral,oh .
neutral,sure .
neutral,"we've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings , so you won't need to deal much with the transportation system ."
neutral,She sure knows how to strut her stuff .
neutral,I think you've lost it .
neutral,"because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there ."
neutral,"we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel ."
neutral,everything's great . And you ?
neutral,I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married .
neutral,"Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ?"
neutral,"I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late ."
neutral,I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw .
neutral,Maybe you should start seeing someone else .
neutral,that's true . But I have a low opinion of those women who go out with foreigners .
neutral,not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent .
neutral,"let me guess , your parents want you to marry a Chinese man , right ?"
neutral,I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up .
neutral,what about renting a restaurant and treating the employees to a nice dinner ?
neutral,"well , we can ask people to make small contributions ."
neutral,"I don ' t think so . I don't think people are going to like it if they have to pay to come . But we certainly can cut costs in other ways , such as make the party BYOB ."
neutral,so we're just going to have a party where they bring their own drinks and we just give them some snacks ? I don't know how well that will go over .
neutral,"true , take my former supervisor as an example . He was extremely controlling and overbearing . He always had to micromanage everything ."
neutral,"hi , Natasha , how's life ?"
neutral,"I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me ."
neutral,I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ?
neutral,"yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children ."
neutral,yeah ! She could do anything she wants to me !
neutral,all right . But I think you ought to move soon .
neutral,I haven't accepted the position yet and with the upcoming holiday I think it's the perfect chance to visit the city and take a good look at the company before deciding . If you have time I think we c
neutral,"well , I spend a lot of time watching movies ."
neutral,is it good ?
neutral,"yes , you can find almost all new releases there ."
neutral,is it a horror movie ?
neutral,"yeah , I love horror movies . Would you like to go with me tomorrow ?"
neutral,"that's funny , I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside ."
neutral,"Um , let me see , romance , comedy . documentary , action , science fiction , animated and so on ."
neutral,"that is to say , you like all genres except for horror movies ."
neutral,not quite . I also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
neutral,our company is going to do some cutbacks soon .
neutral,"I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ?"
neutral,how about tango ?
neutral,maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure .
neutral,"you can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks ."
neutral,thanks . Some tea would be nice . Chinese tea is great . I really like your tea set . Where did you get it ?
neutral,"oh , there is a supermarket not far from here . But there is also a tea house around the corner , where you can get tea and a tea set as well ."
neutral,"to be honest , I wouldn't ."
neutral,not really . But it has puzzled me for a long time .
neutral,"don't worry . I think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together ."
neutral,I guess you're right . But I still prefer to have no child .
neutral,what would it be like ?
neutral,"well , it would be spacious and located next to a park , because a nice view is important to me ."
neutral,"I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would b"
neutral,"I think TV is a great waste of time , so I would only have one small TV in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning ."
neutral,finally we're on board !
neutral,are they window seats or aisle seats ?
neutral,thanks . Where shall we put our luggage ?
neutral,"I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment , and the others can go under the seat ."
neutral,ok . Hope it's a pleasant trip .
neutral,and no hijackers .
neutral,"oh , you have too wild of an imagination ."
neutral,thanks .
neutral,are you also going to Beijing ?
neutral,"yes . There were always so many people . After taking the subway during the rush hour , you ’ ll envy sardines in their cans ."
neutral,I was in New York for a wedding .
neutral,it's got to be almost a year now .
neutral,"yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look ."
neutral,great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days !
neutral,"it's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it ."
neutral,did you have to pay a deposit ?
neutral,"no , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month ."
neutral,Good luck !
neutral,"I could , but all they ever talk about is work , so I always end up feeling left out ."
neutral,it can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you .
neutral,my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate .
neutral,three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive !
neutral,"oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ?"
neutral,"he is tall and slim , fair-haired ."
neutral,"oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ?"
neutral,thanks . This is my power suit . I have a dinner date tonight .
neutral,she's a friend of Amy . We met at Amy's birthday party .
neutral,then who will you meet tonight ?
neutral,really ? Are you sure this is a good idea ?
neutral,please don't be so fussy ! I didn't just meet him yesterday .
neutral,"I know , but remember to meet in a public place and don't give out your personal information ."
neutral,I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me .
neutral,waiting for someone .
neutral,you shouldn't take it too seriously . It might be a lie .
neutral,"they need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though ."
neutral,"my mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start ."
neutral,just a little . Has your toothache gone now ?
neutral,how about your tongue ? Does it still hurt ?
neutral,I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago .
neutral,"you haven't had much luck lately , have you ?"
neutral,I think it's time you took another does of each . What would you like to drink with them ?
neutral,that sounds good .
neutral,"if you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ?"
neutral,"the Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food ."
neutral,they'll still charge us a corkage fee .
neutral,"hey Ayden , I was wondering if you could do me a favor ."
neutral,"let's see , I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend . I can only spare about $ 20 . I would give you more if I had it , I just don't have much money to my name right now ."
neutral,we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .
neutral,"I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here ."
neutral,that ’ s amazing . Do you have a large extended family ?
neutral,"Actually , i popped in them last night ."
neutral,"Well , they're really beautiful people ."
neutral,Yeah . I think things are worked out just fine .
neutral,would you want to live there ?
neutral,"no , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years a"
neutral,"Hey , Vernassa . why be angry look ?"
neutral,"Try to pull it together , Vernassa . I am sure things will turn note , ok ?"
neutral,There are 15 people in my family .
neutral,Wow . That is a very big family . Do you all live together ?
neutral,"Right , but that's where my heart is . But you're right , now there are only 14 living at home ."
neutral,Wow ! you grew up in a school ! No wonder your English is excellent !
neutral,You are so lucky !
neutral,"yeah , an office that runs efficiently by using nothing other than online communication technologies . I pay the rent and share office services with others in the same building ."
neutral,sounds fun.what else ?
neutral,you bet it !
neutral,"My grandpa . He has the final word about almost everything . My grandpa is “ President , ” and Grandma is “ Vice-President . ” My parents , uncles and aunts try to arrive at a consensus on important questions ."
neutral,Of course there'll be a room for you !
neutral,"You are right , I guess.The world keeps changing , and so do families . But I like a small-sized or medium-sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else . That's what I want ."
neutral,I've been studying hard for my examinations . And you ?
neutral,"Did you watch television last night , Charles ?"
neutral,How did it finish ?
neutral,"Good morning , Tom.How are you ?"
neutral,Things couldn't be better.Where are you going now ?
neutral,"After a while , crocodile ."
neutral,"I ’ d like that , but I ’ m flying home this afternoon , and I told my parents I ’ d meet them at the airport for lunch ."
neutral,I heard that you moved to Florida .
neutral,"Yes , I ’ m in Titusville . The space shuttle is launched from near there . I ’ Ve seen a lot of space shuttle launches ."
neutral,I ’ Ve been to all of them .
neutral,I sure will .
neutral,Count on it . And here ’ s my card . Don ’ t hesitate to call me anytime .
neutral,I will . Good-bye .
neutral,"oh , isn't your computer Wi-Fi capable ?"
neutral,"yes , it is . You want go online ? there are no wi-fi hotspots around ."
neutral,"no , I'm not feeling myself . I just want to check my emails , visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends ."
neutral,that's alright . I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . It almost drives me crazy .
neutral,are you a blogger ?
neutral,got it . Are you still updating your blog ?
neutral,"sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like ."
neutral,"yes , it is . Do you consider a frequent check of your income emails to be an integral part of your working day ?"
neutral,do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ?
neutral,do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer ?
neutral,now I can tell you're definitely addicted to the overflow of information .
neutral,Does Jim make a lot of money ?
neutral,No . They want children but no luck yet .
neutral,Wow ... She sounds like a high maintenance wife .
neutral,Politics can be an expensive hobby .
neutral,what date is it today ?
neutral,"Oh , yes ! I completely forgot about it ."
neutral,come on ! three's a crowd !
neutral,so what ?
neutral,He's coming by car on the twenty-fourth . He's staying from thetwenty-fourth to the twenty-sixth .
neutral,"No , he's coming with Aunt Cynthia and the girls ."
neutral,Your cousin Fay is fifteen . Rosemary is older than Fay . She's seventeen .
neutral,"Yes , they do . Do you have a Christmas tree this year ?"
neutral,"If I won the Pools , I'd go round the world ."
neutral,Would you ? I wouldn't .
neutral,What would you do ?
neutral,"Oh , I don't know . I'd buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids , I suppose . But it's difficult to imagine having a lot of money ."
neutral,"One thing's certain . If I had a lot of money , I wouldn't work any more ."
neutral,Wouldn't you ? What would you do with all that spare time ?
neutral,What would you do after that ?
neutral,"Anyway , we haven't won the Pools , and we're not likely to win them . So there isn't much point in talking about it , is there ?"
neutral,And my wife would be happy if I bought her a mink coat .
neutral,"Well , I'm not likely to get a rise and you haven't the money for a mink coat , so let's come down to earth and have another drink ."
neutral,I'm going to stay in the city .
neutral,It is wonderful . What's John going to do this summer ?
neutral,I'm going to be a clerk .
neutral,What does a clerk do ?
neutral,Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ?
neutral,"Which of the two do you think is better ? I mean , what's the difference between them ?"
neutral,"Well ... this one costs more , but it has a much better sound.This part of it is made of wood , not plastic . And there's a tone control , too ."
neutral,I only want it for the kitchen . I like to listen to the news at breakfast time .
neutral,"Hmm ... I'd like the cheaper one , please . Can I pay hy cheque ?"
neutral,"He's a bit tired . You know , he goes to school at eight o'clock every morning.He doesn't get home till after four . then he does his homework after tea . It often takes him a couple of hours to finish"
neutral,"Poor boy . They work hard at school nowadays , don't they ? Does he like it ?"
neutral,That sounds good !
neutral,"Me too . But I tell myself that if they don ’ t accept me , another school will ."
neutral,"Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts . However , a few free k"
neutral,I don't know . Who ?
neutral,"yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ..."
neutral,"not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer , too ."
neutral,crazy !
neutral,I'll call you .
neutral,"okay . Nope , it's a replay of yesterday's soccer match between Brazil and Spain ."
neutral,"it's a total rip-off of an American reality show , but the imitation is unbearably clumsy ."
neutral,have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ?
neutral,that makes you feel uncomfortable ?
neutral,"i have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding ."
neutral,"well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it ."
neutral,"I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results ."
neutral,"to begin with , I have to use chopsticks ."
neutral,but you look quite proficient in using them now .
neutral,anything strang about that ?
neutral,"can you play a musical instrument ? If you can , he might ask you to join the band ."
neutral,"I won $ 10 in the lottery last month . Perhaps next time , I ’ ll be luckier and win the jackpot !"
neutral,"yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work ."
neutral,so do i . I don ’ t like cats .
neutral,I can ’ t make a decision . You ’ ll have to put forward an idea .
neutral,"I often do , but I ’ m worried about the responses from other people ."
neutral,that ’ s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .
neutral,I might do that too . I hope the weather is nice . I could go and play some golf .
neutral,I heard that janet has got a new job . She ’ s working for the united investment group . I hear that they pay very well .
neutral,they did . He inherited the money form an uncle . I hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government .
neutral,"no , but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a hours for all the hard work I ’ Ve put in recently . I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way ."
neutral,The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
neutral,I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height !
neutral,"I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher ."
neutral,what do you have for breakfast ?
neutral,that sounds nice . How do you spend your mornings ?
neutral,how do you spend your afternoons ?
neutral,I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . It was called unusual plants and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features .
neutral,Well . There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them .
neutral,"No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action ."
neutral,Which sports are popular in your country ?
neutral,Do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ?
neutral,I know . i could not believe it when i got hit by that storm.it was pouring with rain all afternoon .
neutral,The weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like.our weather is so changeable .
neutral,I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced .
neutral,Does it ever rain in summer ?
neutral,I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies .
neutral,What do you do in winter ?
neutral,Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze !
neutral,Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts .
neutral,Can you ride a horse ?
neutral,Is there a lot of crime in your city ?
neutral,It ’ s the same in my city . We also have a lot of drug addicts . A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
neutral,I thought you had been to Australia too .
neutral,"No , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and new Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ?"
neutral,"When in Rome , do as the Romans do , they say ."
neutral,Once a week . Most nights I sit at home and watch telly
neutral,"I don't know yet . My wife's going to her mother's for a couple of weeks . She Livesay the sea , you know ."
neutral,"Yes , very much . But I need peace and quiet when I'm on holiday . What are coughing to do ?"
neutral,"Not really , but once I won a prize ."
neutral,"What was the party like last night , Jean ?"
neutral,I'm not certain . Do you know ?
neutral,In a way that's right . But the Vikings travelled there long beforeColumbus . And what about the Red Indians ?
neutral,"It's a beautiful day , isn't it ?"
neutral,"What a nuisance ! Every time I plan to go canoeing or camping , a storm comes along . The sky gets dark , the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops.Well , I'd better stay home ."
neutral,For a short time . One of the engines caught fire .
neutral,What did the pilot do ?
neutral,He put it out and flew back to the airport . Then he asked the people at the airport where the emergency runway was .
neutral,"Yes , we did . But I shall never fly again ."
neutral,Well . . . perhaps you should think about it .
neutral,I think there must be .
neutral,"no , but we're trying to contact them ."
neutral,"Thank you , but I am in a terrible mood indeed ."
neutral,I ’ m betting the New York Yankees win . How about you ?
neutral,"Sorry , guys . Could I just interrupt for a moment ? My money is on the Yankees !"
neutral,"Hey , Ken . Good luck if you already put your money on the Red Sox ."
neutral,"it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening ."
neutral,like what ?
neutral,"if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy ."
neutral,what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ?
neutral,"to be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment ."
neutral,"Excuse me , what do you want for this bag ?"
neutral,Let me see . The one goes for $ 17 .
neutral,Would you take $ 12 ?
neutral,13.50 ?
neutral,I have never experienced a roller coaster . I want you to sit beside me .
neutral,"Wait a moment , I want to go to the toilet ."
neutral,You try to put on a brave face .
neutral,Nice dress . How do I look ? Be honest .
neutral,Hmm ... you look too dressed up . How about this purple top and these jeans ?
neutral,Be confident . Wear styles you ’ re going to be comfortable in .
neutral,Thank you all the same .
neutral,You know them ?
neutral,"Look , Bob . This is a photograph I took during my trip to Australia ."
neutral,Guess !
neutral,"It ’ s not you , is it ?"
neutral,"Oh , I ’ Ve already seen it . I saw it on television last year . It ’ s an old film , but it ’ s very good ."
neutral,"Paris in the spring , eh ?"
neutral,I ’ m sure she is .
neutral,Where do you come from ?
neutral,"It's mild , but it's not always pleasant.The weather's often cold in the North and windy in the East . It's often wet in the West and sometimes warm in the South ."
neutral,I like spring and summer . The days are long and the nights are short . The sun rises early and sets late . I don't like autumn and winter . The days are short and the nights are long . The sun rises late
neutral,Of course I did . As recognition for a job well done . Once a month I invite the most productive employee to dinner .
neutral,"Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days ."
neutral,Where do you come from ?
neutral,"I don't know , sir . What's the number of your car ?"
neutral,Will you travel by sea or by air ?
neutral,We may travel by sea .
neutral,"It may be cheaper , but it takes a long time ."
neutral,Let me see it .
neutral,What's you name and address ?
neutral,Here you are .
neutral,"Yes , he has . He sold it last week ."
neutral,Has he moved to his new house yet ?
neutral,He's a very nice person . We will all miss him .
neutral,When will the new people move into this house ?
neutral,Just a little please .
neutral,"Can ’ t you come in and have tea now , Peter ?"
neutral,"Yes , Look out of the window ."
neutral,But if we spend all that money we shall be poor again . What will we do then ?
neutral,But it doesn't have all the modern convenience offered by the city .
neutral,Charles Dickens.Actually no one can parallel him in writing .
neutral,"Unfortunately , I just can ’ t make it this time . I have to go straight home . It ’ s my second wedding anniversary , and we ’ re supposed to be having a big dinner Susan would kill me if I missed it ."
neutral,"Well , feel free to drop by my office any time . The door ’ s always open ."
neutral,What do you think of the acting of the two main actors in the film ?
neutral,"Well , I'm afraid not . I think the hero has much more to be believed in ."
neutral,I don't think so.It ' s impossible to equate wealth and happiness .
neutral,How do you know that ?
neutral,How are you making out these days ?
neutral,Don ’ t give me your attitude . Please tell me .
neutral,I ’ m so sorry that I have got to go . I have a business appointment right now .
neutral,You are right . My mum must be crazy .
neutral,"Darling , the airplane is going to take off . I have to go ."
neutral,This is a precious opportunity for us and our company .
neutral,"May , my grandpa is ill . I will go to look after him . Catch you later !"
neutral,"Don't worry , your baby is in my home ."
neutral,Because they are rednecks .
neutral,"Really ? What about your opinion , Daniel ?"
neutral,"You have always got your nose in the air , which hurts many boys ’ hearts ."
neutral,Did you listen to the weather forecast ?
neutral,Whose name did you pick ?
neutral,Booze !
neutral,"Hey , let ’ s go to the night market after work tonight ."
neutral,"Actually , you might because there ’ s a big convention in town this weekend ."
neutral,I ’ m not too worried about it . I always seem to find something .
neutral,"Let me check.Oh , oh ! It ’ s at 3:25 ."
neutral,"Wow , that's cutting it close ! That means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! What gate is it at ?"
neutral,It ’ s at ... gate 14 .
neutral,"Oh , great ! That ’ s at the other end of the terminal !"
neutral,"OK , so here ’ s the plan ; When we land , run to gate 14 !"
neutral,"Yes , we do . They are all in this book ."
neutral,How long were you married ?
neutral,Have you remarried since then ?
neutral,"I don't know much about him . He died when I was just a baby . Even though I don't have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother , I consider them to be my real family ."
neutral,Sounds like it was ment to be .
neutral,What's so interesting about it ?
neutral,"It said that he's hoping to get a face transplant , but until then , he's looking forward to Halloween so he isn't the only one wearing a mask ."
neutral,"Oh , sure . Once they reached middle age , they became a lot less uptight ."
neutral,Where did you go to university ?
neutral,I ’ m a freelance writer . i write magazine articles and fiction books
neutral,"No , I didn ’ t . I was an english teacher for about five years , but by the time I was thirty , I decided I want a fresh challenge ."
neutral,"Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ?"
neutral,"I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children !"
neutral,Let me think about it for a minute . Let's see ... oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! Give me a second and it'll come to me .
neutral,"She's fairly tall , maybe 2 inches taller than me ."
neutral,Is she chubby ?
neutral,Not at all . She's actually very athletic .
neutral,It's a butterfly - everyone in her family has one .
neutral,It's instructive and inspiring .
neutral,"No , it's a semimonthly ."
neutral,"They are . And not only that the people are friendly , but also the food is delicious , not to mention cheap ."
neutral,"Very well , thanks . Nice to see you again . I haven't seen you for a long time . What have you been doing lately ?"
neutral,"Oh , sorry . Cross my fingers ."
neutral,"Yeah , I agree with you . But you know , it's just one of those things ."
neutral,Please yourself .
neutral,I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days .
neutral,Daniel . Mind your eye !
neutral,"Well , you have three kids , so you knew what it meant once upon a time !"
neutral,"Ha , ha ! Those days are long gone ."
neutral,what are you doing ?
neutral,did you play a lot of games when you were little ?
neutral,"I hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same !"
neutral,"so , which sport do you prefer---basketball or baseball ?"
neutral,"to be honest , I don't really care for either one ."
neutral,my absolute favorite is ice hockey .
neutral,have you ever seen a live game ?
neutral,I've never really understood the game .
neutral,"thanks , that'd be nice . When's the next ice hockey game on ?"
neutral,"not for a while , but we could watch an old one on the internet so I can explain the game to you ."
neutral,what did you do last night ?
neutral,it ended in a tie .
neutral,what was the actual score ?
neutral,"if Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won ."
neutral,"I didn't see the crash itself , but I did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents ' apartment building ."
neutral,that must have been horrible . Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on ?
neutral,did he survive ?
neutral,you know ; I heard that she was opening a school for underprivileged girls in Africa .
neutral,did either one of them win an Oscar this year ?
neutral,"as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health ."
neutral,people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .
neutral,I never really give them money because I don't want to contribute to their addictions .
neutral,homeless youth can easily become involved with drugs and prostitution . Do you do anything to help them ?
neutral,I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
neutral,"I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !"
neutral,"regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs ."
neutral,there's a great sitcom on Channel 3 that stars in about three minutes .
neutral,why not ? I don't have anything better to do !
neutral,I spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat .
neutral,have you ever been in an earthquake ?
neutral,"yes , I experienced one when I was in Tokyo once . The tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over ."
neutral,"no , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . It actually happened the day after he bought the car !"
neutral,"I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself ."
neutral,That's easy . Everyone knows that there are nice .
neutral,"I'm dead serious . They've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore ."
neutral,"I suppose you're right . They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around ."
neutral,what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ?
neutral,it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking .
neutral,"you're right , thanks . There's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that I want to finish ."
neutral,"it's Martin Scorsese . You liked his film , The Departed , didn't you ?"
neutral,"yes , it was fantastic ! Can I read the article when you're finished ?"
neutral,"I bet you'll still buy it , though . You wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine !"

neutral,"I'd love to , but I'm allergic to strawberries ."
neutral,That sounds good . What's the charge ?

neutral,The lab is completely free . But you do have to pay a dime a page for printing .
neutral,You'll see this charge on your amenities account .
neutral,It won't be long until your food is delivered . I know you'll enjoy it .
neutral,No problem . I'll tell you about our alternatives .
neutral,And may I suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ?
neutral,"Okay , no strawberries . Room service will be charged to your amenities account . Is that all right ?"
neutral,Great ! How much is it for a copy ?
neutral,"Could you be a little more specific , sir ?"
neutral,"I understand . Now , you're saying that you've already used up all your amenities ?"
neutral,"Yes , yes . Souvenirs ."
neutral,"That's not the same thing . If you buy hotel souvenirs , they have no sentimental value ."
neutral,"I understand , sir . I'll call housekeeping . You'll have your souvenirs shortly ."
neutral,"Yes , I need more amenities ."
neutral,"Okay , I got it . You've already run out of all your amenities ?"
neutral,I'm more confused now than before . How is there a problem ?
neutral,"I'm sorry , sir . I'm not sure I understand ."
neutral,Please ! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs .
neutral,"I understand completely , sir . Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment ."
neutral,"Hi , I need to copy something right now ."
neutral,"Our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine , sir ."
neutral,There you go . My friends expect me to bring home souvenirs .
neutral,"Have you visited our souvenir shop , sir ? It's loaded with all kinds of items ."
neutral,I need some to keep as souvenirs !
neutral,"We do have a souvenir shop on the first floor , sir ."
neutral,I'll call housekeeping . Someone will be up with more amenities shortly .
neutral,Fantastic ! Is there a charge ?
neutral,"Well , I'm only making one copy , so I guess I can afford it ."
neutral,"In the good old days , it was only five cents a copy . I'll be right down ."
neutral,Thank you for your honesty . I assure you there will be no cockroaches next time .
neutral,"Thank you . I'll just print out your receipt , and then you're free to go . Here you go !"
neutral,"This hotel could use some insecticide , but my time in New York was thoroughly delightful ."
neutral,Thank you .
neutral,"I'd be willing to try this hotel again , if you can promise me no more cockroaches ."
neutral,"Just one second , sir , and I'll give you your receipt . Here you go ."
neutral,"This could be a great hotel , once you get rid of the insects . The city itself is great ."
neutral,I knew you'd see it my way .
neutral,"She deserves nothing but the best , of course ."
neutral,I promised her I would take her out to a restaurant . Do you have another one in mind ?
neutral,"You can always go to Gramercy Tavern . It's quite popular , despite its expensive entrees ."
neutral,Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word .
neutral,"I agree with you , sir , but all I do is work here ."
neutral,"Well , what do you think about our very own hotel restaurant ? It is very upscale , with a three-star rating ."
neutral,I don't want to be cooped up in my own hotel tonight . How about another restaurant ?
neutral,"I'm already dialing , sir ."
neutral,"Well , this wouldn't be the first time that a file was wrong . Just a moment , please ."
neutral,Nothing but the best for a pretty woman !
neutral,"Gramercy Tavern is at least as good as our own hotel restaurant . Plus , they have live jazz ."
neutral,"Therefore , I think I'll explore New York some more . But I need to store my bags ."
neutral,"Well , then . Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment ."
neutral,"Better hurry , sir . Remember you have to check out in less than half an hour ."
neutral,"We do have a storage space for your bags . There's a small charge , plus a deposit ."
neutral,Leave a deposit ? Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit ?
neutral,"Regrettably , no . But simply present your VISA to cover your deposit ."
neutral,Hmm . I'll have to think about this for a second .
neutral,"In case you didn't know , I'm checking out in half an hour ."
neutral,What can I do with my baggage while I visit a few more tourist spots ?
neutral,Isn't my baggage enough of a deposit ?
neutral,"I wish it was , but it isn't . They will still want a credit card ."
neutral,I'm going to Rockefeller Center .
neutral,We have various transportation services . Would you prefer a private vehicle ?
neutral,Rockefeller Center .
neutral,Some people find a limo to be much more comfortable than a taxi .
neutral,"No , I wouldn't be caught dead in a limo ."
neutral,"Good , I'm leaving my room in about one minute ."
neutral,Can you get me a taxi ?
neutral,"No , I hate limousines . They're gas guzzlers ."
neutral,My destination is Rockefeller Center .
neutral,"Okay , I'm coming downstairs now ."
neutral,there's free Internet access in the lobby .
neutral,fantastic . Thank you very much .
neutral,"Rockefeller Center . Can you get the taxi here immediately , please ?"
neutral,"A taxi will be here in just a minute , sir ."
neutral,"The taxi will be ready when you are , sir ."
neutral,What time should the taxi be here to pick you up ?
neutral,"I'll have a taxi for you momentarily , sir ."
neutral,"You'll enjoy our new , clean taxis , sir ."
neutral,May I see your passport please ?
neutral,You're not carrying any food with you today ?
neutral,Sure . There ’ s a lot here in this pamphlet .
neutral,Thank you . And what ’ s the best way to get downtown ?
neutral,"Yes , do you have any rooms available ?"
neutral,"Please fill out this form , sir ."
neutral,Ok ... Here you are .
neutral,"Ok , Mr . Smith . Do you have any bags to check ?"
neutral,And would you prefer a window seat or an aisle seat ?
neutral,Thank you .
neutral,Good afternoon ! Trans Pacific Airline . How can I help you ?
neutral,I ’ m calling to cancel my reservation for Trans Pacific Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis . Could you please make it for the same flight on August 2 instead of July 19 ?
neutral,"What ’ s your name , please ?"
neutral,"How do you spell your name , please ?"
neutral,Please note that this ticket has a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation .
neutral,That ’ s correct .
neutral,"No , thanks . I ’ m all set . Good-bye ."
neutral,"Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm ."
neutral,"Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time !"
neutral,"Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers ."
neutral,it ’ s about six or seven miles . That ’ s about the kilometers .
neutral,"yes , we can , but it isn ’ t very interesting ."
neutral,that ’ s right .
neutral,"that ’ s fine . Are there signposts along the way , in case we get lost ?"
neutral,Do you think I can take a picture through this window ?
neutral,I think it ’ s over five meters long . I can ’ t remember exactly . It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour .
neutral,wow ! That ’ s fast ! I don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway .
neutral,"So , what do you plan to do today ?"
neutral,Outside or inside ?
neutral,"Oh , sorry.It stands for the Museum of Modern Art . It's an acronym . M O M A MYOMA ."
neutral,How can we get up there ?
neutral,excuse me ? How can I get to the nearest branch of the national bank ?
neutral,then keep walking until you reach the war memorial . It ’ s a big statue of a soldier . You can ’ t miss it .
neutral,I want to book a tour with adventure sports .
neutral,"Mmm . OK . Well , why don ’ t you tell me a little bit more about what you would like ? We have everything from mountain biking , to rock climbing to street luge ."
neutral,"I have the perfect option , this package will take you on a hiking trip through the Himalayas for three days and afterwards there ’ s a dog sledding journey !"
neutral,"Straight on , and turn right . Is it far ?"
neutral,I think something in the countryside would be nice .
neutral,We want to see the Statue of Liberty too .
neutral,I have never done that myself . But I hear it is very interesting . You two should go .
neutral,"Here is your key . Your room is 379.You can find the elevators just around that corner there , down the hall.Enjoy your stay , Ma'am ."
neutral,Thank you .
neutral,"Alright , let's go then . How many tickets do we have left ?"
neutral,I was only interested in the Haunted House and the roller coaster rides.The other rides are for kids .
neutral,May I help you ?
neutral,"Yes , my name is Carol Tiang . That's spelled J - I - A - N - G ."
neutral,C - A - R - O - L . Carol .
neutral,"Are you sure he used your name , Ma'am ? Maybe he reserved under his name ."
neutral,I'm sorry . I have nothing here .
neutral,"Miss , I know he made this reservation for me ."
neutral,"I don't agree . I think the Capitol building is the most famous.But okay . If you want to see the White House , we'll go see it . I'm just afraid it will be boring ."
neutral,So is it the right way to the City Hall ?
neutral,"No , that's not true.The White House is very big . And there are a lot of historical exhibits there.The tour will take us through many different rooms . I read about it in the guide ."
neutral,"Hmm . If that's true , then the security there must be very good.Because it's strange to think they will let people walk around in the White House ."
neutral,I'm not sure . I think it lasts about one hour .
neutral,"O . K . Ticket , please ."
neutral,"Would you like a window or an aisle seat , Mr . Smith ?"
neutral,"I want an aisle seat as close to the exit door as possible , please ."
neutral,Very well . Do you have any bags to check ?
neutral,"You , too ."
neutral,"Excuse me , Miss.What did the announcement say ?"
neutral,"Oh , will you ? That's too bad.We ' re very sorry to cause you a lot of trouble ."
neutral,"Oh , what a relief ! Thank you very much for your help , Miss ."

neutral,Here they are .
neutral,Do you have anything to declare ?
neutral,"Yes , I have two cartons of cigarettes , one bottle of whisky ."
neutral,"Yes ma'am , may I help you ?"
neutral,Our room hasn't been cleaned up yet.So would you send one of your housekeepers to clean up our room ?
neutral,Right . Let's go and find some fun .
neutral,"OK , I'll call ahead ."
neutral,Something important ?
neutral,Tickets ? What tickets ?
neutral,Air tickets ?
neutral,Yes . Think about it carefully .
neutral,It is our 10th wedding anniversary this June 20 .
neutral,I have made a mistake ?
neutral,"Yes . We had planned to marry on June 20 , but something happened , so we had to put off our wedding day ."

neutral,"I am sorry to trouble you , but there's a lot of noise in the next room ."
neutral,"Oh , is there ? Which room is it ?"
neutral,"It's . I think , neighbours on the right ."
neutral,"Yes , I believe so.How should I compensate for this ?"
neutral,"I'm afraid , ma'am , you have to pay U . S . $ 100 since you lost the key ."
neutral,"Can I help you , ma'am ."
neutral,"Yes , will you keep our bags until 6 p . m . ?"
neutral,Are you all our guests ?
neutral,I was in my friend's room talking for an hour of so .
neutral,I'm afraid you must give up the cash.Are you insured ?

neutral,"So , basically , I am OK ?"
neutral,What will I learn when I see the results on the website ?
neutral,Is there a medication you can prescribe to help me with my problem ?
neutral,There are various choices of blood pressure medication that we can try .
neutral,Are there many side effects ?

neutral,How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ?
neutral,What types of drugs can I try ?
neutral,Do I only need to take that one drug ?
neutral,You will feel much better except for the fact that you might have a little cough .
neutral,The doctor sent me over here to have my blood drawn .
neutral,"Certainly , please have a seat and roll up your left sleeve ."
neutral,"For water retention , I am going to start you on Hydrochlorothiazide , which is a diuretic ."
neutral,Your doctor has requested a check of your white blood count .
neutral,I am putting a tourniquet on your arm to plump up the vein . It will only feel like a little pin prick .
neutral,Have you been having any problems lately ?
neutral,You are in the right place . Roll up your left sleeve and have a seat .
neutral,What am I being tested for ?
neutral,I get an idea of the pressure in your arteries when your heart is pumping blood versus at rest .
neutral,"I ’ Ve noticed that it is worse when I am under stress , like during finals week ."
neutral,I feel that you should see a pulmonary specialist to check for asthma .
neutral,Have you had any type of cold lately ?
neutral,Does this happen all the time or mostly when you are active ?
neutral,It happens a lot when I work out .
neutral,I am going to send you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma .
neutral,My coach wants you to check my blood pressure .
neutral,Has anyone ever told you that you had high blood pressure ?
neutral,I don ’ t have any symptoms of high blood pressure .
neutral,It tells me how hard your heart pumps blood and how much your arteries relax at rest .
neutral,"No , I ’ Ve been feeling fairly good most of the time . It just is hard to breathe ."
neutral,Does this happen more when you are under stress ?
neutral,"When the weather gets really cold , it gets worse ."
neutral,What kind of personality do you think you have ?
neutral,"I am quite outgoing , I think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with other people ."
neutral,What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
neutral,Do you have any friend you would call really close ones ?
neutral,"Yes , I would call three of my former classmates really close friends . We often get together and talk with each other . Whenever I counter difficulties , they are always ready to give me a hand ."
neutral,"Yes , it definitely bothers me more when I do that ."
neutral,"Sorry , I'm supposed to be with my son ."
neutral,Is everything under control ?
neutral,Is it okay to have a day off next week ?
neutral,"Okay , I'll see you later ."
neutral,May I help you ?
neutral,But I ’ m not in there very often . It ’ s so noisy that I can ’ t work .
neutral,I'm very sorry . But Mr . Stephen must leave for Hong Kong right away .
neutral,What seems to be the problem ?
neutral,"Following the rules of world business , the exporters have the right to inspect the goods before the delivery , while the importers have the right to re-inspect the goods after their arrival ."
neutral,When are you going to take your vacation ?
neutral,Thank you for your compliment . I bought this PC with my first-month salary . I am getting to know the on-line trade .
neutral,"Sure , but every coin has two sides . Doing business through the internet is not as safe as doing business through traditional ways ."
neutral,I heard you were promoted to general manager of IBM ’ s China Head quarters .
neutral,"We can complete a trade by email , electronic data interchange and smart cards , and so on ."
neutral,"Firstly , it can overcome the geographic limitation . And secondly , e-commerce can lower the internal costs . And thirdly , people like us , can also open stores on Internet ."
neutral,"That's true . However at the Fair last March , people were so interested in Chinese garments that the demand this year will surely increase ."
neutral,Do you think it will help if we appoint a local agent ?
neutral,Our prices compare favorably with those offered by other manufactures either in Europe or anywhere else . Here are our latest price lists . You will see that our prices are very attractive .
neutral,"Sure , we do ."
neutral,How long does it usually take you to make delivery ?
neutral,"As a rule , we deliver all our orders within three months after receipt of relevant L / C . It takes longer , of course , for special orders . In no case would it take longer than six months ."
neutral,"Good . One more thing , we'd like you to quote us on CIF basis ."
neutral,"Let's look at that another way . The major point is the value that we add , not who has been in business longer , or is bigger ."
neutral,"We do not want to place ourselves in an inferior position . We are a good , small company---that's why you are interested ."
neutral,Good .
neutral,"Sometimes you might feel dizzy , but that isn ’ t common ."
neutral,"If I couldn ’ t wait , could the prescription be mailed to me ?"
neutral,"I got poison oak while hiking , and I need something to help me with the itching ."
neutral,You are welcome . Please feel free to ask me a question any time you need help .
neutral,I need to get my prescription filled .
neutral,Can I take it with food ?
neutral,You should take this medicine with food and no alcohol .
neutral,"When you brush your teeth , what do you use ?"
neutral,Absolutely . That set it off big time !
neutral,"I picked up some poison oak while hiking , and I can ’ t stop itching ."
neutral,How long has your tooth been bothering you ?
neutral,Have you injured your tooth in any way ?
neutral,I think one of my fillings might be coming loose .
neutral,"Oh yeah , when I do that , it hurts a lot more !"
neutral,Should I just stand naturally ?
neutral,I came here to get a chest X-ray .
neutral,What comes next ?
neutral,Your arms need to be raised to shoulder height .
neutral,"So far , so good ."
neutral,You will be able to put your clothes on as soon as I have checked the film .
neutral,I don ’ t feel so good . I am feeling sick to my stomach .
neutral,Do you think that maybe you are getting the flu ?
neutral,You need to come over here and face this plate .
neutral,I will need your arms raised to shoulder height .
neutral,Are you going to leave ?
neutral,You can get dressed as soon as the film is processed . We will be all done here .
neutral,I have a major stomachache
neutral,Did you eat something strange ?
neutral,I had spaghetti with clam sauce for lunch .
neutral,Maybe you have food poisoning .
neutral,You don ’ t look so good .
neutral,Do you know who you got it from ?
neutral,A lot of people in my dorm are sick . Perhaps I picked it up there .
neutral,"Mostly , I feel like I need some rest and hot soup ."
neutral,"If things don ’ t get better in a few days , I will look for some other solutions ."
neutral,not too well ! I ’ m just to the doctor . I haven ’ t been feeling too well .. over the last few days .
neutral,OK . I can afford to take a fell days off work .
neutral,have you been working hard recently ?
neutral,"don ’ t worry about that . It ’ s probably of the stress you ’ Ve been under . Just take some aspirin . Combined with the stronger cough medicine , it will make you feel very tired . You shouldn ’ t work or use an"
neutral,Does it hurt ?
neutral,"If I ’ m better this afternoon , can I go to school ?"

neutral,It began the night before last .
neutral,I've been feeling pretty ill for a few days now .
neutral,have you been drinking plenty of water ?
neutral,Ow !
neutral,"What's the matter , Andy ?"
neutral,"Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year ."
neutral,"I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ?"
neutral,What is the matter with you ?
neutral,"I'll give you some medicine , and you will be better in a couple of days ."
neutral,Thank you .
neutral,It began with a shiver then I perspired a great deal .
neutral,Will you open your mouth ? Your throat is swollen .
neutral,Have a good day at school ! See you tonight !
neutral,"First we will take some x-rays and see what we ’ re dealing with . I also noticed a small cavity up front here , so you are going to need a filling ."
neutral,Mom ! ? ? ?
neutral,"Oh , you've got a fever . One-oh-one ... time to break out the children's Tylenol ."
neutral,I have the chills . Can you turn on the heater ?
neutral,"I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track ."
neutral,you bet it !
neutral,why ?
neutral,"Hi , Rock Sam ! Hey , I am surprised to see you doing so well ."
neutral,"Haha . Don ’ t worry , Betty . So tell me , what ’ s the latest gossip ? Unless you want to keep it to yourself ."
neutral,Good morning ! Marquette General Hospital . Tia speaking . May I help you ?
neutral,What is the matter ?
neutral,"Well , you can come to a work-in clinic today . You do not need an appointment ."
neutral,Ok . Thank you very much .
neutral,"first of all , we'll tailor a work-out plan according to your physical conditions and your personal needs ."
neutral,"OK , I'll take it ."
neutral,What are your symptoms ?
neutral,Does it hurt when I push here ?
neutral,No .
neutral,For about a month .
neutral,"We can do an allergy test , and later I can send you for an asthma test ."
neutral,I am expecting the tests to go well . I have been taking good care of myself .
neutral,Good morning . How are you ?
neutral,"Because I feel tired all the time , even when I wake up in the morning . I find very difficult to do any work . I have no appetite . My wife cooks me delicious meals but I can only eat a little ."
neutral,"No , doctor . I never have enough time for exercise . I start work very early in the morning and finish late in the evening . Then I can't get to sleep . Can you give me some medicine to help me to sleep ?"
neutral,"I can , but I'm not going to . You don't need medicine . You need advice . Don't work so hard . Too much work is bad for you . Don't worry about your work.It ' s silly to worry . Take regular exercise ."
neutral,"Well , Peter . I'm sorry you're ill . What's the matter with you ?"
neutral,"I don't know , Doctor . I'm ill . I have a headache and a stomachache ."
neutral,"Yes , I ate some cake ."
neutral,I see ! How many pieces of cake did you eat ?
neutral,And this ?
neutral,"Hello , I would like to speak with Ryan ."
neutral,I have a horrible rash from poison oak .
neutral,The doctor said that I probably have had it a few days .
neutral,"Hi , is this Professor Clark ’ s office ?"
neutral,This is Professor Clark speaking .
neutral,"I broke my leg , but it is healing ."
neutral,"Fine . Well , thanks for calling and letting me know you will be absent . I hope you feel better soon ."
neutral,I am happy that you have decided to come in for your annual physical .
neutral,I ’ Ve been having trouble with congestion in my chest . Can you give me some tests for that ?
neutral,"Good morning , is this Ryan ?"
neutral,This is Ryan you are speaking with . What can I do for you ?
neutral,"I have a concussion , but I will be OK ."
neutral,I appreciate you calling and telling me that you won ’ t be in class . See you next week !
neutral,"Yes , I am Professor Clark ."
neutral,"Yes , how are you doing ?"
neutral,"I was partying hard over the weekend , fell down the stairs , and need time to recuperate ."
neutral,How many days will you be out of school ?
neutral,The doctor said I should be good enough to return next week .
neutral,"Professor , excuse me , but I need to leave early ."
neutral,Have you ever tried doing relaxation exercises before you go to bed ?
neutral,Is everything OK ?
neutral,What exactly seems to be the matter ?
neutral,I have a terrible headache .
neutral,Is there some reason why you can ’ t get enough sleep ?
neutral,I usually try to go to bed around 11
neutral,Has everything been OK with you lately ?
neutral,I haven ’ t been able to get a good night ’ s sleep lately . I ’ m exhausted !
neutral,Have you been too busy to get enough sleep ?
neutral,"I have had headaches my whole life , but they have been getting worse lately ."
neutral,"I would if I knew anything for sure , but I want to take a second look ."
neutral,Does this mean that you have bad news for me ?
neutral,I just want to talk to you about the tests that I want to run .
neutral,I don ’ t know anything for certain . We always do a double check if there is a question .
neutral,I have been getting headaches almost every day lately .
neutral,Have you just started getting a lot of headaches ?
neutral,I ’ m sorry . How about sleep ? Are you getting enough rest ?
neutral,"I have been working really hard , and sleep has not been a priority ."
neutral,I like you to come in and discuss some further tests that I would like to run .
neutral,I think that this is a bad sign .
neutral,"If there is any question about test results , we always do a recheck ."
neutral,"I would be happy to see you this afternoon . If you are feeling upset , please bring a friend or relative along ."
neutral,Come on in this afternoon and we will talk . It will be fine !
neutral,"I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts !"
neutral,349-95- 8821 .
neutral,Can I sit down now ?
neutral,First I need to get your address . Try to move your arm as little as possible .
neutral,It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
neutral,"A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you ."
neutral,"Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor ."
neutral,"Good morning , how are you doing today ?"
neutral,Thank you . What will the blood test tell you ?
neutral,"We will be checking for blood sugar , cholesterol , and white blood cell count ."
neutral,"No , I haven't . I need help quick . It hurts really badly ."
neutral,"It is . But unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait.You aren't bleeding , are you ?"
neutral,"Oh , that's terrible . Is it your right arm or your left arm ?"
neutral,My left arm .
neutral,"Yes , it is . But even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done.Have you ever been in an emergency room before ?"
neutral,"Hi , Mr . Smith . I ’ m Dr . Hawkins . Why are you here today ?"
neutral,"Yes , well you haven ’ t had one for ... five years . You should have one every year ."
neutral,"Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit ."
neutral,"Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I ’ ll give you more information before you leave ."
neutral,"Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut ."
neutral,"Calm down , sir . We ’ ll call her to make sure she ’ s on the way ."
neutral,Thanks . Sorry . It just came as such a surprise . The baby isn ’ t due for another two weeks .
neutral,About fifteen minutes .
neutral,Yes .
neutral,"Oh , no . He ’ s not breathing , and there ’ s no pulse . Call 911 ."
neutral,"Hello ? Yes . Someone has passed out at Connecticut Ave . and 1st St . He isn ’ t breathing and does not have a pulse . Yes . My friend is performing CPR . OK . Thank you . They ’ re sending an ambulance . Here , let me help ."
neutral,Does it hurt when I push here ?
neutral,"Oh , my God ! It ’ s my stomach . It ’ s killing me !"
neutral,Do you have a history of stomach pain ?
neutral,"Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out ."
neutral,Where are you feeling the pain ?
neutral,I can ’ t stand up ! My stomach is killing me !
neutral,Did this just come on suddenly ?
neutral,We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is .
neutral,"Good morning , I would like to make a doctor ’ s appointment ."
neutral,I would like to see Dr . Smith .
neutral,"Hi , I need to make an appointment to see the doctor ."
neutral,I need an appointment on Tuesday .
neutral,"Fine , I am putting you down for 9"
neutral,"Are you going to be OK to drive home , or would you like someone to go with you ?"
neutral,What time was it scheduled for ?
neutral,It was for two o ’ clock in the afternoon .
neutral,I would like to switch it to next Friday .
neutral,"Ah I see , yes you do sound rather croaky . Well let ’ s have a look , shall we ? Could you please open your mouth and say ” ah ” ."
neutral,Ahhhhhhhh
neutral,"When you made your appointment , what day did you choose ?"
neutral,Let me see a doctor .
neutral,"Be brave , sir . It won't be long . I will fill out the form for you . What is your name ?"
neutral,Steve Schliessman . S C H L I E S S M A N .
neutral,Come on ! Stop being so vain . You look great ! You are beautiful !
neutral,"I don ’ t see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You are 25 , stop being ridiculous . Besides , I think that people who get Boto , have facelifts , or tummy tucks look weird . It doesn ’ t look natural ."
neutral,I think you need to get brain surgery . I honestly don ’ t think you need cosmetic surgery . You look amazing .
neutral,My appointment was on Monday .
neutral,What time had you chosen ?
neutral,What time would be best for you ?
neutral,I want to come in at 2
neutral,I am writing you down for that time . We look forward to seeing you .
neutral,"Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription ."
neutral,Thanks doc !
neutral,Are you a medical or surgical case ?
neutral,I'm a medical case .
neutral,The doctor told me to stay about one month .
neutral,Certainly . See you in the afternoon .
neutral,"Thanks , doc . I ’ Ve got a really bad toothache ! I can ’ t eat anything , and look , my face is all swollen . I think it might be my wisdom tooth ."
neutral,"Well , let ’ s have a look . Open wide . Hmm ... this doesn ’ t look good . Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We ’ ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse , and the crown probably needs to be refitted . I ’ m going to order some x-rays ."
neutral,"No , not at all ! Just lay back and relax ."
neutral,"Yes , the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad . And the pain comes intense when I walk too much ."
neutral,"Yes , I have ."
neutral,Does the pian become more intense at night ?
neutral,"By the way , does acupuncture hurt ?"
neutral,Is there anything I should do ?
neutral,You'd better have a good rest for a week . Be sure to have regular meals . Stay away from alcohol . Give up smoking at least a little while .
neutral,Good . Now the other eye .
neutral,"Never mind , just read as far as you can ."
neutral,"No need to worry . You won't feel anything at all . I'll give you an injection to stop the pain . Just wash your mouth out with this water , will you ?"
neutral,Yes . Sometimes I can notice a constriction in the chest and shortness of breath after a fit of sneezing . And I often suffer from a running nose with a profuse watery discharge .
neutral,"Yes , things like seafood and penicillin-type drugs ."
neutral,Has this been a problem before ?
neutral,"Not too serious , but it'll take you some time to recover , so you'll need to be patient ."
neutral,What's the problem ?
neutral,"Yes . Three , I think . It wont ' be too painful . Alright , we're done . That wasn't so bad , was it ?"
neutral,"And show me your tongue ... Thank you . That'll do . You have slight tonsillitis , and your throat is inflamed . How is your appetite ?"
neutral,"Now , let me take your temperature . Please put this thermometer under your armpit and let me feel your pulse ?"
neutral,Would you prefer to take similar medicine of other brands ?
neutral,Could I ?
neutral,Thank you .
neutral,"If I ’ m better this afternoon , can I go to school ?"
neutral,Let me see ... Perhaps I could fit you in at five thirty .
neutral,Five thirty ? I have a dinner appointment at six .
neutral,I guess it can't be helped .
neutral,How kind of you ! Good-bye .
neutral,Here you are .
neutral,Do you have a registration card ?
neutral,One of the back ones .
neutral,"I have a bad headache , but ..."
neutral,"Oath , I think I broke my leg ."
neutral,Thanks .
neutral,The doctor will be with you in a moment . I just need to ask you a few questions .
neutral,All right .
neutral,"Name , age and date of birth , please ."
neutral,I don ’ t have it .
neutral,I don ’ t have health insurance .
neutral,What wrong with you ? You look pale ?
neutral,"Now , Let me have a look at you . I ’ d like to listen to your chest . Breathe then , deep breath , that ’ s it . Cough , now again . I want to exam your throat too . Open wide , say A ."
neutral,"All right , thanks ."
neutral,The tests showed nothing wrong . a slight by infection .
neutral,What shall I do today ?
neutral,"Thank you , doctor . I ’ ll do what you say ."
neutral,"Yes . Is there anything you can give me to get rid of it , doctor ?"
neutral,The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic .
neutral,Thank you !
neutral,"James Taylor , 23 , March 30,1982 ."
neutral,"Hello , Doctor ."
neutral,How long has this been going on ?
neutral,"Pretty good , I'd say ."
neutral,"You haven't lost any weight , have you ?"
neutral,"Well , doctor ?"
neutral,"Well done , Fred . Do you know something useful for our promotion for our I-series ?"
neutral,"OK , Let me see . I suppose we must strengthen our promotion , because our brand is still new to some consumers . Maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously , because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places . Besides , the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products ."
neutral,That is a good idea to start with . I also think the mass media is also a good approach for advertising .
neutral,"Yes , the mass media has wider influence . One of my classmates works in an advertisement company . I can get help and inspiration from him . And we can also try some less expensive approaches of advertising , such as on-line sales . Personally , I prefer to the on-line sales , for it is cheaper , faster and wider ."
neutral,"OK , I'll take a message ."
neutral,"Overtime work is very common in companies . I can work overtime if it's necessary , but I don ’ t think we will work overtime everyday ."
neutral,Do you like regular work ?
neutral,May I ask how much I can get every month ?
neutral,Thank you . Miss Kelly .
neutral,I can type 120 words a minute and I take shorthand at 80 words a minute .
neutral,"Yes , I would . ( After testing )"
neutral,"All right . You need to have an interview with our manager , Mr . McBride . Let ’ s go to his office ."
neutral,It's beyond question . You can save it the same as a document .
neutral,What if it exceeds the capacity ?
neutral,This is Michael Richard speaking . Who is calling ?
neutral,You gave me a deep impression then . Can I help you ?
neutral,We have made the decision to hire you .
neutral,"I will , thank you for calling ."
neutral,How many places have you worked altogether ?
neutral,Oh . Then I don't know what his number is . Can you check it for me ?
neutral,"Well , Miss Liu , I've enjoyed talking with you . Thank you for your interest in this job ."
neutral,"We hope to make a decision in the next few days . We'll notify you of our decision by mail , is this convenient for you ?"
neutral,Good-bye .
neutral,I want to live abroad and learn to speak a different language .
neutral,"Thank you , manager ."
neutral,"Sorry , Tom , can you say that last bit again please ? We didn ’ t get that ."
neutral,"Sorry Tom , We're having problems hearing you here . It ’ s a bit hissy . Can you hear us ?"
neutral,Hello ?
neutral,( XXXXXXXXXX ) but I don ’ t think you can hear us . ( XXXXXXXXXX ) Hello ? ( XXXXXXXXXX )
neutral,"Well , I was a diligent student when I stayed in my college . I dislike meeting the deadline , when I am working on a project . I am always willing to complete it well ahead of the schedule ."
neutral,I will start my work at the beginning of next month .
neutral,Let me see . It's £ 800 per set CIF London .
neutral,"Considering our good relationship and our future business , we give you four percent . That's the best we can do . We can't go any further . What would you say to it ?"
neutral,"Well , I see . And what about the vacation in our company ?"
neutral,"As a new-comer , you usually have five days of annual vacation . And remember you have to fill out a request form , if you want to ask for leave ."
neutral,"B , your main duty is to answer phone calls and transfer files to the person who wants them . Is that difficult ?"
neutral,"It's easy . Is there anything I can do for you , sir ?"
neutral,"Twenty prints and five plain . That makes 5,000 rolls in all ."
neutral,Eight weeks ? We can wait that long .
neutral,Can't you make it seven weeks for the prints ?
neutral,That's right .
neutral,I feel sick and coughed a lot at night .
neutral,"Well , take care of yourself . And hope you will be better as soon as possible ."
neutral,"I fully understand your position . An irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . But , on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . We've been , after all , trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . Can't you give us D / A or D / P ?"
neutral,"But on our part , our government is reluctant to approve of L / C payment for our imports . And there is the licensing problem ."
neutral,"Well , considering our long standing good business relationship , we'll try hard to negotiate with our manufacturers for an earlier delivery ."
neutral,Thank you for your consideration . When will you let me know your answer ?
neutral,This afternoon .
neutral,"Besides , Internet tends to be more essential now in the information age ."
neutral,"You are right . The current equipment of our offices really falls behind . Next week , you can provide me a catalogue of new equipment ."
neutral,"David , how is your interview ?"
neutral,Don't be rush . It is suggested to write a letter for the Personnel Department of Future Clothes Company .
neutral,Could you show me how to operate this fax machine ? I am going to receive some urgent fax from a company .
neutral,What can I do next ?
neutral,We'd like you to execute the first delivery by June 30 and the second delivery by August 15 .
neutral,"I'm sorry , but June 30 is quite soon . I can't guarantee 1 500 cases , I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1,000 cases and the next 2,000 cases ."
neutral,Actually not so good . That's why we made a special trip to see you .
neutral,Good . I want to discuss with you the mode of payment for the construction of the power plant under negotiation .
neutral,We will carry out the order when the purchase order gets here .
neutral,"Well , I am worried to death right now ! There is still no news from the company for me ."
neutral,Let it be ! Time will tell .
neutral,"Well , please look at the employment contract . I'd like to go over the main details again before signing . First , you will be getting a monthly salary , and no probation is involved ."
neutral,"Yes , I get it . Will the medical plan cover me while on duty ?"
neutral,"Yes , any approved overtime of more than two hours will be paid twice of the salary or take time-off ."
neutral,"Fred , is it a good time to talk with you ?"
neutral,What do you think we can do about this ?
neutral,"We are not willing to miss the chance ; however , our staff is not big enough now . So , to be honest , I want you to help me to finish all these programs ."
neutral,"OK , that's all . We'll inform you in two days ."
neutral,Thank you .
neutral,"Just use your head . If you were definitely making some big mistakes , you would be informed ."
neutral,"That is merely a dream . Remember , there is always room for us to have further improvement . I think we did the good job in the whole period ."
neutral,I know what you are talking about . The performance evaluation process starts from the day we're hired . There is no surprise during the actual review .
neutral,How do you feel what you have done ? Did you meet our goals ?
neutral,"Stephen , can you work overtime tonight ?"
neutral,Did he say why ?
neutral,"Just a moment . I'll tell you about that in a minute . Where was I ? Oh yes . By way of illustration , let ’ s look at the top five destinations in the UK for this kind of traveler over the last five years . If you look at page ten you can see what I mean . In spite of these characteristics of the market , I still think there is room for growth in the youth sector ."
neutral,I see . OK . So what ’ s next ?
neutral,Good morning . This is Dan . Could I speak to Nova ?
neutral,Really ? When will she come back ?
neutral,The file for the meeting needs to be retyped and please send it to us as soon as possible .
neutral,"Next week there will be a meeting with the manager of USE Company ; this is an important opportunity for our company to have a new relationship with a new partner . So , I want you to prepare an instruction book with detailed introduction of our products . This introduction will be presented in the meeting ."
neutral,How about adding some pictures of our products for the introduction ?
neutral,Good idea ! The pictures will illustrate the performance of our products vividly .
neutral,"Janice , I can't find the document I was working on last month . Can you help me to look for it ?"
neutral,I am sure that document was filed .
neutral,"Hello , my name is Clark . May I speak to Mr . Allen , please ?"
neutral,"Experience is indeed very important , but don ’ t you think capability is more important than it ?"
neutral,"Of course , I think so . But how can you prove to me that you are more capable ?"
neutral,"Hi , Jimmy , good morning ."
neutral,Yes . I have given all the designers notice of meeting by telephone .
neutral,"George , I heard our eighth generation computer is appreciated by the guests . They intend to sign contract with our company . You have done a good job . We are so proud of you ."
neutral,Thank you . But I am not sure whether the manager is settling for it . She asked me to go to her office .
neutral,"Keep working hard , and then you will get another chance of promotion someday ."
neutral,"Sorry , could you repeat that please ?"
neutral,"Yes , 123 456 789 , Mary from Happy Travel . Have you got that ?"
neutral,So you suppose you deserve a salary raise .
neutral,"You ought to point out how valuable you are , and tell her those people who have the same situation also get the salary raise ."
neutral,Remember it is the boss who hires you and tell her how much you have improved the office efficiency .
neutral,"That's a point . It seems a little complicated . I will think about this for a while . I owe you one . After all , you give me an inspiration ."
neutral,"Yes , since 1993 , I ’ Ve been employed as a clerk in the Beijing Branch of the DHAK Trading Corporation ."
neutral,"Yes , I have read the Filling Instruction carefully , since you showed me it last week ."
neutral,The essence of filing I remember is to bring together in a single folder or file all papers relating to a particular subject . And outgoing and incoming letters are kept in this file cabinet .
neutral,"And each file should be named clearly , either in block capitals or in jet black typed capitals ."
neutral,Correct .
neutral,When can I contact you about your final decision ?
neutral,"Well , I really appreciate your coming today ."
neutral,That sounds good . But I have a proposal now .
neutral,"No , you don ’ t . My name is Liu Lili . I got the information from the TV that your department wants to hire a clerk , who will work under you . I would like to apply for the job ."
neutral,Do you enjoy your work ?
neutral,"To be frank , not very much , because I can ’ t use much what I ’ Ve learned in my work . I enjoy doing more challenging work ."
neutral,Anything else ?
neutral,"Correct . I have expected to visit here for a long time . So fortunate for me , I can realize this expectation and meet you , Arden , and your kind-hearted staff in your company ."
neutral,"Thank you for your interest in this job . You'll be hearing from us . Send the next applicant in on your way out , please ."
neutral,May I call you at your home about our final decision ?
neutral,": How are you , Mr . Ding ? I ’ m John Brown ."
neutral,"Pleased to meet you , Mr . Brown ."
neutral,Do you have any questions ?
neutral,"How can I help you , sir ?"
neutral,I am here to have a discussion on your company's investment issue .
neutral,"Yes , I did it yesterday . Our meeting should be 2 pm ."
neutral,"Firstly , we can provide our meeting agenda before he comes . And then on the day when he is coming , we wait for him at the gate of our company's gate ."
neutral,It's an honor and a privilege to receive a visit from such a distinguished group .
neutral,"Mr . Chandler will be our new partner , so his visit this time will be extremely important for our cooperation in future , because it may decide whether Mr . Chandler sign the trade contract with us or not . Do you have some idea ?"
neutral,"Dear fellows . As you know , Mr . Ross will be leaving us very soon after his short but meaningful visit to our company ."
neutral,"I really want to stay a little longer , but I still have a meeting to attend . All in all , I am so impressed by your hospitality and your warm welcome . Thank you for the trouble you have taken ."
neutral,How long will you work a day ?
neutral,That ’ s rather hard .
neutral,"The company provides labor insurance for all employees , as well as fine retirement policy ."
neutral,I will be accompanying you on your tour today to visit our company . This is the assembly line . These drawings on the wall are process sheets . They describe clearly how each process goes on to the next step .
neutral,How many workers are there on the lines ?
neutral,How do you control the quality of the products ?
neutral,"Well , all products have to go through five checks in the whole process . We believe that the quality is the soul of an enterprise . There fore , we always put quality as the first consideration ."
neutral,"Mr . Chandler , this way please . I will show you a five-minute multivision about the history of our company ."
neutral,"Hello , the International Hotel . May I help you ?"
neutral,"Yes , I'd like to make a reservation for eight tonight ."
neutral,What time would you like your table ?
neutral,"Wait for a moment , please . Let me check whether the private room is available or not . No problem ."
neutral,"Of course , here you are . And you can ask me any question ."
neutral,"Okay , I can ’ t decide whether sign or not now . Can you give me some time to think it over ?"
neutral,Okay . Can you give me a reply tomorrow ?
neutral,"Well , Betty . Since you ’ Ve done well during the probation period , we decided to employ you formally . And now we need to sign the formal agreement ."
neutral,"Yes , maybe the personnel department made some mistakes in making the agreement . Do you have any other questions ?"
neutral,"Is there anything after the meeting ? In that case , would you add one plan ? I want to visit our guest Mr . Ross after the meeting . Can you arrange it for me ?"
neutral,"My present pay is RIB 3 , 000 yuan each month ."
neutral,What's your expected salary ?
neutral,"Yes , it is quite satisfactory . I accept it ."
neutral,I would like to know if there would be any opportunity to work abroad in the future ?
neutral,"Yes , we have inspection abroad ."
neutral,"The Smiths are arriving at our city tomorrow . Can you draw up a schedule for them ? If they want to make any changes , minor changes can then be made ."
neutral,"Madam , I made a close study of the draft contract yesterday evening . I think there are something needs to modify ."
neutral,"Yes , it seems to me we have come quite a long way . However , let me take a close look at the final draft ."
neutral,Do you have some points to bring up ?
neutral,"Well , everything we've discussed seems to be here ."
neutral,I'll need a few minutes to check over my notes again on every detail . What about the quality standard ?
neutral,"We've settled price , order , payment , now I am calling to ask about package . How can we pack the goods ?"
neutral,I see . Why not use wooden cases ?
neutral,Sounds good .
neutral,Can you give me a wholesale list ?
neutral,"Yes . It depends . If you have a large order , we will give you a discount ."
neutral,"Of course , he would . Would you leave them with me ?"
neutral,Two months at most .
neutral,"Hi , Bob , this is John Lin ."
neutral,"Hello , John ."
neutral,When will I know your decision ?
neutral,Thank you for your interest in our company .
neutral,Have you done any work in this field ? What have you learned from the jobs you have had ?
neutral,What course did you like best ?
neutral,Project Management . I was very interested in this course when I was a student . And I think it's very useful for my present work .
neutral,"Yes , I have studied in an English training program and a computer training program since I graduated from university . I am currently studying Finance at a training school ."
neutral,Do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us ?
neutral,"That's right , even though I did set the alarm last night ."
neutral,Your clock never works . Perhaps you should buy a new one .
neutral,"David , we have been doing business for three years , haven't we ?"
neutral,"You know we went great lengths to promote the sales of your products . Through our continuous effort , consumers tend to accept your product . So , there will be a potential market for your product in this area , and would you let us act as your agent ?"
neutral,"Our price is worked out according to the costing . A 20 % commission means an increase in our price . So , I'm afraid we have to decline your proposal of acting as our sole agent ."
neutral,"Oh , that's pitiful ."
neutral,"Yes , sir . Most of us had positive review in last quarter . Take Fred and David for examples . Both of them try their best to achieve the best . Their progress is distinct , especially in last quarter ."
neutral,"They are popular in and out of our department . Fred is easygoing , while David is cautious in working ."
neutral,All these say a lot for their characters .
neutral,Why not ? You've done so well for the company . She should give you a prize .
neutral,But we still have to find one . Can we find Arden to check whether this is true or not ?
neutral,"The price of CPU is 260 dollars above 1,000 Units ."
neutral,Can you reduce more ?
neutral,This price is the best we can make .
neutral,"Well , I got all the point . All the decision will be made since I get the approval from my supervisor ."
neutral,You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where .
neutral,"Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ?"
neutral,"To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help ."
neutral,Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable .
neutral,"Well , let's have your firm order ."
neutral,"Yes , here is our offer , 30,000 skirts at 200 yuan per skirt , FOB New York . You will find our price comes in line with the prevailing market ."
neutral,It doesn't seem very hopeful to close the deal on this price .
neutral,"Well . We only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable L \ C , payable against shipping documents ."
neutral,"It's for free , because your computers are still in the period of guarantee--two years ."
neutral,Great ! When can your technicians come to our factory ?
neutral,To provide the As excellent after-sales service is our motto . Please wait for our maintenance staff in your factory tomorrow afternoon . They will be there on time .
neutral,Are you having a meeting ?
neutral,I felt dizzy when I stare at those shining lights . What should we do firstly ?
neutral,"Now we should design our booth . Do you know the number for our booth , B ?"
neutral,Let me see the notice . It is here . Our booth number is E108 . Good number .
neutral,Lucky number . Find its location now .
neutral,These are your products ?
neutral,Would you sit down and write down your name and address here ?
neutral,OK ! Would you like to recommend some for our reference ?
neutral,When should I tell him to call back ?
neutral,All right .
neutral,Thank you .
neutral,"Marry Lin's Office , this is Linda ."
neutral,"Linda , this is David Wang ."
neutral,"Certainly , hold on ."
neutral,"Dodge Automobiles , may I help you ?"
neutral,"John Li's Office , this is Jenny , may I help you ?"
neutral,"Yes , but let me check if he's available ."
neutral,Good morning everyone . Thank you for attending the meeting today . I'm sure you all have a copy of the agenda . So let's get started with the first issue .
neutral,I see .
neutral,"I really appreciate the offer , but I must decline it ."
neutral,"Hi , is this Sue ?"
neutral,Senior account rep .
neutral,"I'm sorry but my bottom figure is $ 36,000 ."
neutral,Arden wants to have a trademark for our new series of products registered . But I have no idea on the registering process .
neutral,It is known that there is a time limit for trademarks . And we should not have a similar trademark with the one in the same field .
neutral,Some relative documents will be needed and the fee may be quite dear . So you need to learn more about the process and regulations about this issue .
neutral,I am reading the book on patent and I think it will be helpful for my work
neutral,Yep ! I heard that your company is registering a new trademark .
neutral,"As you know , we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion , so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product , L-series ."
neutral,Is there a bonus system or any other incentive plan in place ?
neutral,"Very good . It's a pleasure to do business with you , Mrs . Phoebe ."
neutral,"I always approach things very enthusiastically . When I begin something , I don ’ t like to leave it half-done . I can ’ t concentrate on something new until the first thing is finished ."
neutral,What makes you angry ?
neutral,How was your interview ?
neutral,Sure . What's your date of delivery ?
neutral,What about the balance of the order ? Can they also arrive at our company quickly ?
neutral,"I was looking forward to something a bit more substantial . As you know , we have long-time cooperation ."
neutral,Are you more of a leader or a follower ?
neutral,"I don ’ t try to lead people . I ’ d rather cooperate with everybody , and get the job done by working together ."
neutral,Do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ?
neutral,"Hello , Robert . This is Frank . I'm coming to Guangzhou on the the 7th and I'd like to call in to discuss the project plan ."
neutral,Can we make it 11:30 ? A customer will come to the office at 11 .
neutral,"Perhaps one year , I'm not sure ."
neutral,You're very kind to say so . Thank you . Do you think tomorrow morning would suit him ?
neutral,I understand . When do you think I can come and see him tomorrow afternoon ?
neutral,I see there are some workmen on the site . When is the building work due to start ?
neutral,About ten weeks in total if everything goes according to plan .
neutral,"I'm sure it will . So , we should be able to start moving the machinery in during week 34 . I'll confirm that date with our suppliers ."
neutral,Here are the plans for the new finished goods warehouse . Do you have any thoughts or comments ?
neutral,How's the building work going ?
neutral,We've taken on a civil engineer on a nine-month temporary contract . He'll oversee the whole project . In fact we're having a project meeting at 3 p . m this afternoon allocate responsibilities and finalise the time schedule . Why don't you join us ?
neutral,We've managed to reduce our energy consumption in our factory by about 15 per cent in the last two years .
neutral,Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system .
neutral,"Well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers ."
neutral,We don't use any fossil fuels . Most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants . We're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power .
neutral,Have you always been on this site ?
neutral,That's good service . Do we have to pay extra for that ?
neutral,"Rose , is this you ?"
neutral,"Hello , this is Lucy . May I speak to Mr . Smith ?"
neutral,"Thank you , Mr . Smith . Goodbye ."
neutral,Thank you for seeing me . Did you look over my letter and resume ?
neutral,"Yes , I think it is possible more important than the salary ."
neutral,I see . I'm a female . Are there any special benefits for me ?
neutral,"Well , we are only responsible for the retirement pension . About the unemployment compensation , this will be given by the government ."
neutral,"Oh , just one thing , could you give me some ideas of the pay ?"
neutral,"2,000 RIB per month ."
neutral,"We would like to start you off at 1,500 yuan a month , not including bonus and overtime pay . We don ’ t give bonus every month , but we offer a semi-annual bonus . And you will receive two weeks paid vacation a year , as well . Does it suit you ?"
neutral,No problem . We'll supply you with an apartment of two bedrooms and a living room .
neutral,This will be your office here .
neutral,Where is the break room ?
neutral,What about early next week ?
neutral,I think you deserved this .
neutral,"We need someone rather quickly , the sooner the better ."
neutral,"Well , of course depends somewhat on experience , background and that sort of thing . What are your currently earning ?"
neutral,"I'm glad to meet you , Sue . Please have a seat ."
neutral,We've looked over your letter and resume and I'm very satisfied with them . Today I want to invite you talk about insurance you're interested in .
neutral,"As regards salary , I leave it to you to decide after experience of capacity ."
neutral,No problem . We can offer you a flat with two bedrooms and a living room .
neutral,"If you are satisfied with the conditions here , please sign this contract and give it to me ."
neutral,OK .
neutral,"Kenvir ? Hi , it's Alice . I'm very sorry that I have a big favor to ask you again ."
neutral,"How big , Alice ? Last time you said that , I ended up working overtime 4 nights ."
neutral,What have you learnt from this short experience ?
neutral,I'm going to quit this job . It's way too stressful .
neutral,I'm the Project Manager so I have to make sure our projects run smoothly . I work with three Project Engineers . They take care of after-sales service and look after the maintenance side of the business .
neutral,Could you tell me something about your previous job ?
neutral,Yes . I worked in a small machinery factory . My work was very simple and there was not much work to do .
neutral,"Yesterday I saw your company's advertisement . Your company is an important international company . Working for it , I believe it can improve my abilities ."
neutral,Do you do overtime ?
neutral,We have a three-shift system - that's three eight-hour shifts each weekday . We're shut at weekends . This week I'm on the early shift .
neutral,In Seoul . But the company has operations in over fifty countries and thirty factories all over the world .
neutral,Would you mind answering a few personal questions ?
neutral,"It's in the eyes . They're the type that seems to look into your soul , making one really uneasy ."
neutral,"Whatever we said , we must be more careful ."
neutral,What position have you held before ?
neutral,What made you decide to change your job ?
neutral,Why do you leave your present company ?
neutral,"Good morning , I have an appointment with Mr . Johnson at 10:00"
neutral,"I ’ m sorry , Mr . Richard . Mr . Johnson is on his way to the office . He had just called and asked you to wait a minute ."
neutral,"Well , I ’ ll wait ."
neutral,"Here you are , Mr . Richard . This is the cream and this is the sugar . If there ’ s anything else you ’ d like , please don ’ t hesitate to tell me ."
neutral,"But whether you like it or not , there ’ s a trend of life-long study to make sure that we can keep ourselves up with the high developing society . And you need to accept this concept positively ."
neutral,"It's hard to tear myself away from your friendly people and your ancient country , but nothing lasts for ever . I have to go back home this time , but I'm sure I'll return very soon ."
neutral,Your flight takes off at 8
neutral,"Okay , okay , we'll split it 50/50 ."
neutral,I'm free . What's up ?
neutral,Someone has to pick up the boss at the airport .
neutral,I'm not sure but there seems to be something wrong with it . Is it still under guarantee ?
neutral,Thank you . I wonder whether I can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance .
neutral,"Good morning , Mr . Chu . Would you like me to brief your schedule for today ?"
neutral,"You are scheduled to meet Mr . Thompson of ABC Company at eleven this morning . Then , you have a lunch appointment with Mr . Li . And this afternoon at four you will attend a press conference ."
neutral,All right . Do you want me to cancel the reservation for you ?
neutral,I have been employed as a secretary at a trading company .
neutral,What does your work consist of exactly ?
neutral,Would you mind working overtime at night ?
neutral,How much money are you making a month ?
neutral,Why do you want to resign ?
neutral,"As you know I serve as a secretary in my present company , I really want to look for a more challenging opportunity ."
neutral,We're going to have to postpone the meeting .
neutral,"Yes , most of them . We trained on a dummy system last month . A couple of people were away so we've organised two more training sessions on the live system for the whole team this week ."
neutral,How long will the system be down for ?
neutral,"I am working in a small company where further promotion is impossible , so I decided to change my job . I'd like to find a job which is more challenging ."
neutral,When was it serviced ?
neutral,Just a couple of weeks ago . It's usually very reliable .
neutral,I've just got a new printer . How often do I need to replace the print heads ?
neutral,Is that more expensive ?
neutral,"They're at the back of the stores , second shelf up on the right-hand side ."
neutral,"Oh yes , some wire cutters ."
neutral,"Could you type up this document for me , Sandra ?"
neutral,That's fine . Don't forget to update the inventory .
neutral,"Hi , Sven , can you help me ? Could you hold the end of the tape measure , please ?"
neutral,Sure . So let's see . We need a piece of wood 3.5 m long by 1 m wide . I'll order it right away and I'll be able to install it next Tuesday .
neutral,What's going on over there ?
neutral,How long does that usually take ?
neutral,That's the packing line . The goods are being wrapped and loaded onto pallets ready for transportation .
neutral,"Yes , I'd like to see that . What does it clean exactly ?"
neutral,What does the unit consist of ?
neutral,"Well , it's basically two tanks – one for the dirty solvent and one for the clean solvent , a pump and a washing unit . Oh , and there ’ s a cooling system and a filter . It's all controlled by a PLC system – that stands for Process Logic Control ."
neutral,And what's the maximum output ?
neutral,Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually .
neutral,"Yes , it is . But we need to take out more water . So it then passes through a series of rollers , where more water is squeezed out . After that it goes through the dryers , which are at a very high temperature . The paper is then coated . And finally it's wound onto reels and cut down into smaller lengths ."
neutral,How do you dispose of the waste in your factory ?
neutral,What about the rest ? How do you get rid of it ?
neutral,But doesn't incineration produce carbon monoxide ?
neutral,"Well , we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ’ re not allowed to use lead in our products any more ."
neutral,What happens if you exceed the limits ?
neutral,"Hello , ABC Company ."
neutral,"Hello , could I speak to Mr . Wang , please ?"
neutral,I am sorry . He's out in a meeting now . Could I ask who is calling ?
neutral,Certainly .
neutral,Good morning !
neutral,"Yeah , that would be fine . What time ?"
neutral,"How do you do , Mr . Zhang ? I'm glad to meet you ."
neutral,"How do you do , Mr . Smith ? Let me help you with your luggage ."
neutral,Did you have a good trip ?
neutral,"Of course , sir ... Here's the minutes of the meeting ."
neutral,What should a secretary do to prepare for a meeting ? Can you tell me a bit more about it ?
neutral,"First of all , the agenda should be prepared before the meeting . Then you should ensure that those entitled to be present are properly informed ."
neutral,It's seriously good .
neutral,"Miss Sun , could you please type this report for me ?"
neutral,"Yes , we have a showroom not far away from here , Mr . Black . Are you free now ?"
neutral,"Of course , Mr . Green ."
neutral,You say your products are aimed at the green consumer . In what ways are they environmentally-friendly ?
neutral,"We try to use as little packaging as possible . Also , all our bottles are made of recyclable plastic and we use recycled fibre in our boxes . That's what our customers want ."
neutral,Your hand is bleeding . What have you done to it ?
neutral,What sort of problems do you have with these machines ?
neutral,"They're quite complex machines and they have a lot of different components . We need to check the metal casing regularly for any signs of corrosion . We also check the brushes once a fortnight to make sure they aren't worn down . It's important to make sure everything is properly aligned and we adjust it if necessary . There is a canvas belt at the end of the assembly line . If it gets wet , it might rot so we check that regularly too ."
neutral,What do you recycle in your plant ?
neutral,"Can I take a message , Mr Laing ?"
neutral,"Yes , please . I'm actually returning her call . So perhaps you could tell her that I called ."
neutral,455623 .
neutral,OK . I'll make sure she gets the message .
neutral,"Yes , please . My name's Michael Caxton from one of your customers — Rosedale Investments ."
neutral,"No , it's Caxton ."
neutral,It's about an invoice which is wrong .
neutral,856674 .
neutral,"M , A , double R , I , O , double T ."
neutral,You'd better spell that !
neutral,"Of course . It's H , O , R , S , T , then W , E , I , S , S , M , U umlaut , L , L , E , R ."
neutral,It's the Cygnet Trust .
neutral,"Of course . C , Y , G , N , E , T ."
neutral,Dentale Associates . I'm afraid there's nobody available to answer your call . Please leave your name and telephone number and we'll call you back . Please speak clearly after the beep .
neutral,There have been too many unplanned shutdowns over the past few months . We'll have to make a few changes to the way we operate . We need to reduce our downtime .
neutral,"I agree , but the maintenance team is fully stretched dealing with problems . We don't have time to carry out any preventive maintenance ."
neutral,How often do you service the pump ?
neutral,"Well , from experience we can predict the lifespan of different components . We try to replace components before they fail or wear out . This prevents the equipment from breaking down . It also saves us a lot of trouble !"
neutral,"I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement ."
neutral,"Yes , that's right . I like this city very much and would like to make my home here ."
neutral,Do you know what you will be doing yet ?
neutral,"You don't need to introduce yourself , Yang . You're famous ."
neutral,"Well , that's kind of obvious ."
neutral,"Uh , let's keep this going , shall we ?"
neutral,"Glad to meet you , Mr . Smith . My name is Wang and here is my name card . I'll be glad to do what I can for you ."
neutral,Great ! This is my first visit to the Fair . Everything is new to me . Would you please give me some information ?
neutral,What about your company ?
neutral,"I'd be glad to , sir . But may I ask what line of business you are in ?"
neutral,I'm in the electrical appliances .
neutral,I see . Would you be interested in seeing the audio-visual products ? They are made by our company .
neutral,"Thanks , they are rather attractive . But I think there is nothing better than seeing things In actual operation ."
neutral,"Your products may have certain advantages , but your prices are too stiff ."
neutral,Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 .
neutral,Good luck to us .
neutral,The working hours are from 9:00 to 11:30 in the morning and from 1:30 to 5:30 in the afternoon . Make sure never to be late or absent . Every time you should use the employee card to show you are present whenever you come into the company .
neutral,"For most of the articles in the catalog , we have good supply ."
neutral,"Here's our inquiry list . You'll find the required items , specifications and quantities all there ."
neutral,"Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side ."
neutral,So are we . Our counter-offer is in line with the world market .
neutral,I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .
neutral,"I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % ."
neutral,We spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . We won't sacrifice quality for quick profits .
neutral,"Well , we're really interested in placing an order under negotiation . We can start the negotiations as soon as you want ."
neutral,"Fine . As well , would you mind if I asked to see the Loyd's surveyor report of your products ? I may have a few more questions about your quality analysis ."
neutral,But a quality inspection system does not mean that each unit will always be up to the standard .
neutral,We have trained analyzers to do quality analysis at the end of each part when we make the product . This means that no mistakes are made .
neutral,"Certainly . We provide quality analysis training as part of the training for all new workers , plus a week of further training every year ."
neutral,Don't act like this . Please have good thoughts in your mind . What's behind you ?
neutral,"OK , you ’ ll need to reboot your machine . Press Control , Alt and Delete at the same time ."
neutral,That's why you can't open it . You'll have to upgrade before you can read the file .
neutral,"Yes , it is . As you know , some of the materials we use are highly-flammable so we have a very strict non-smoking policy in the factory ."
neutral,"It means there must be no naked flames or sparks anywhere near flammable materials . If the materials ignite , it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them ."
neutral,Have you checked your connection settings ?
neutral,"Yes , of course . When you hear the fire alarm , which is a very loud , continuous ringing noise , you should go to the nearest fire exit or fire escape as quickly as possible ."
neutral,Should I try to put the fire out ?
neutral,"I'd like to have rest , but I have many things to do ."
neutral,How about this post-trip ?
neutral,I did clerical stuff and ran errands .
neutral,"In this office , we encourage full attendance by offering a bonus . If you take any leaves , we'll deduct money from your salary ."
neutral,"We'll give you about 3000 to start . There'll be a trial period of three month . After six months , we'll have a job performance review and consider giving you a raise ."
neutral,Could you arrange a meeting with your boss ?
neutral,What personality traits do you admire ?
neutral,"Honest , flexible and easy-going ."
neutral,I feel that learning how to motivate people and to work together as a team will be the major goal of my leadership .
neutral,I will try to present my ideas in a more clear and civilized manner in order to get my points across .
neutral,I am quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like leaving things half done .
neutral,Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
neutral,Slacker and those who violate working procedures and ignoring deadlines .
neutral,How about tomorrow afternoon ?
neutral,Yes . We keep finding problems when testing the sound boards .
neutral,"That will involve additional expenses for us , which we will have to pass on to you as a rate hike ."
neutral,What did you exactly do there ?
neutral,"We can borrow from a bank , the gross interest rate will be something like 7 % . With corporate tax at say 30 % . We are only paying on 50 % of this . There is still inflation to consider ."
neutral,We can borrow as much as we can .
neutral,"Not quite , if we get too heavily in debt , the shares will tend to drop ."
neutral,Good morning . Elly company .
neutral,"Good morning . Could I speak to someone in the sales department , please ?"
neutral,"Hold on , please ."
neutral,"That is excellent , your investment proposal is a wise decision . May I have some idea of your suggestion ?"
neutral,"I worked as a personnel manager in a state-owned company , and then I transferred to joint venture as a sales manager . So I am familiar with the food market in China ."
neutral,What have you learned from the jobs your have had ?
neutral,I have learned some skills about how to deal with clients and how to behave myself as a personnel manager .
neutral,"I preferred working with other colleagues when I worked in my previous company . I think teamwork and cooperation are very important . No matter how competent he or she is in a company , he can ’ t do without them ."
neutral,"Yes , I think I can in ordinary circumstances ."
neutral,Do you think you can speak English quite fluently ? Tell me about your English education .
neutral,I have passed CET - 6 and I am proficient in reading and translating foreign materials . I have rich translating experience because I used to be an English translator .
neutral,What are the most fundamental concepts underlying the accounting process ?
neutral,"If you order in large lots , we'll accept the price ."
neutral,We think the price is too high .
neutral,"In foreign trade , exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner ."
neutral,How to adjust ?
neutral,"Am . Well , can I have a try of the sample free of charge ?"
neutral,Thank you . We'll order once we try the sample .
neutral,Many exporters speak French and German as well .
neutral,"Yes , the language is a part of culture . It reflects a nation's character ."
neutral,"Yes , it not only includes the nation's historical and cultural background , but also contains the nation's view of life way of life and way of thinking ."
neutral,I understand . Thank you .
neutral,"We really appreciate your efforts . Before we go to the core of matter , can you give us some idea of them on which you would be willing to operate as our agent ?"
neutral,My name is Steven . I'm the Sales Manager of this company .
neutral,Your legal department is very good at these things . We can trust them with the drafting of the agreement .
neutral,Thank you for inquiring . But your enquiry is too vague to reply .
neutral,OK .
neutral,Yes . I was a member of the basketball Society . I like playing basketball .
neutral,Would you mind telling me your grades in high school ?
neutral,Of course not . My school record was above average in my class .
neutral,They are above 90 . I ’ m in the upper third of my class . I have worked hard at my major subject .
neutral,"I have just left school , but I am well acquainted with office work ."
neutral,What can you contribute to the position of a market analyst ?
neutral,"I know how to gather and summarize information from the Intent , which is an essential skill for market analysis ."
neutral,I am a good accountant and have a thorough knowledge of the English language .
neutral,It wasn't as high as I would have liked . It was 2.5 .
neutral,OK . Would you like to file them according to dates ?
neutral,Not bad . I ’ m proficient in both written and spoken English .
neutral,"I took a part-time job last semester in translating and doing reception work for an exhibition . My work included hosting the visiting foreign exhibitors , communicating with them , arranging their agenda , and translating several materials . I think this activity well demonstrated my ability in English . And I will be glad to take any form of English test you arrange for me to prove my ability ."
neutral,But the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers .
neutral,I think I can figure this out . Let's see if this works as advertised . Say ' cheese ! '
neutral,I think you will find these are the best digital cameras on the market today .
neutral,Can you finish it on time ?
neutral,"OK , I will send Beker to help you . We need to get the brochures done and sent them to our clients on Friday without delay ."
neutral,OK .
neutral,"Practice makes perfect . By the way , what do you learn from your job ?"
neutral,Good morning ! May I help you ?
neutral,"Susan , can you give me a hand ?"
neutral,It's easy . Press O and then P . Then it will ask you for your password .
neutral,Thanks !
neutral,"So , what's the status of our advertising campaign ?"
neutral,"I suggest that we focus on slice of life , showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool ice-cream sandwich ."
neutral,What's your products ' competitive edge ?
neutral,"That shouldn't be a problem , as long as we can make ends meet ."
neutral,That's right . What can I do for you ?
neutral,"Our factory locates at a village in the east of the city . The area of it is 3,600 square meters ."
neutral,There are two shifts now in total .
neutral,"Most of them live in the city . We provide free commuter buses for the workers . Besides , we built the dormitory building for the workers on night shift ."
neutral,I'm here to sign the agreement .
neutral,I will try my best . Here is the draft . Would you please go over it and see if any modifications are needed ?
neutral,"Let me have a look.Well , it contains basically all we have agreed upon ."
neutral,"If you totally agree , I'll type the agreement this evening and have it duplicated for signatures ."
neutral,"I think so , too . Our only request is that the quality is in conformity with the contract stipulations ."
neutral,But what will you do if the goods we receive are not standard ?
neutral,"OK , no problem . I hope there are no questions about the terms ."
neutral,OK . Where do you want me to sign ?
neutral,We want to order some of these products .
neutral,Can you supply us right away ?
neutral,"Good , we'll take 500 suits ."
neutral,"I thought you would be worried about it . So I rang Auckland last night . As you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave Auckland next month ."
neutral,"Good , if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then ."
neutral,Can you tell me something about the balance sheet now ?
neutral,"Yes , of course . The balance sheet contains 3 major sections , that is , assets , liabilities and owner's equity ."
neutral,"If a client complains about the service of your department , what will you do ?"
neutral,"I am sorry to say I haven't , but I have taken many other courses that concerns the PR , such as Social Psychology , Public Affairs and Mass Communication ."
neutral,Not at all . That's what I should do .
neutral,Have you had any medical experience in any hospital before coming here ?
neutral,A little over 3 years .
neutral,How do you do ? I need your help in selecting a foreign market to invest !
neutral,"Our country is a free trade nation . She was mainly agriculture and rather a backward country and mow has developed into a modern highly industrialized state with an expanding economy . Parallel to this , her dependence upon foreign trade has increased . Increased output generates a greater need for raw materials , semi-finished products and capital goods . Thus . in many fields , our country is an important and growing market for exporters from other countries . But this doesn't mean that our country is an easy market , because of a liberal import policy and the high standard in our market is keen ."
neutral,What is your greatest strength ?
neutral,"I always give each job my best efforts , so when others are not pulling their weight , I am frustrated ."
neutral,I got the Scientific Research Prize from the Gansu government for my achievements in the Northwest Regional Economy Development Research Project .
neutral,"I stick to my principles and keep to the rules . Sometimes , they just lack enthusiasm and I get them involved with something constructive . Some of them change their attitude later ."

neutral,"Yes , I do ."
neutral,The re-examination results indicate that one-third of the goods are not up to standard .

neutral,We are more interested in finding someone who is alert and quick at figures . Do you like meeting the public ?
neutral,"That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 ."
neutral,"That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount ."

neutral,"As a trial order , I'll take 5,000 dozen this time ."

neutral,"Let me see , I would like to work my way up to a senior management position with a company such as yours ."

neutral,What are you typing there ?
neutral,"Yeah , I just got some good information off the internet ."
neutral,I didn ’ t just find out about one job . There were several ones that looked good .

neutral,I think I can handle it by myself .
neutral,"We often ignore the acknowledgments in our daily life , and consider them as disposable ."

neutral,"Yes , it is not easy ."
neutral,May I ask whether we need to work overtime ?
neutral,"Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview ."
neutral,"Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation ."
neutral,"To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression ."
neutral,You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for .

neutral,Do I often have to work overtime ?
neutral,"Yes , you have to work overtime a lot due to the editing job ."
neutral,"Jack , I don't know how to write my resume . Could you tell me about that ?"
neutral,"Such as your land line phone number , mobile phone number and e-mail box ."

neutral,You are expected to report for on-job training on the 15th of May . Will you be there ?
neutral,I'm willing to wait until you have come to a decision .
neutral,"As I said , I am diligent and industrious . On the other hand , I am too hard-working and I put myself under much pressure to make things perfect ."
neutral,"Well , I see ."
neutral,That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
neutral,Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ’ t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
neutral,"Yes , this is . May I help you ?"
neutral,"Oh , the results have come out , and I can tell you ... Yes , I find your name . You are hired . Congratulations !"
neutral,"Your starting salary is 2500 yuan a month , and after you become a permanent employee , it will be higher ."
neutral,"Wait , will I have five insurances and one fund ?"
neutral,What is your long-term goal in this career ?
neutral,"You are welcome , Mr . Sun ."
neutral,"I just know a little . First you need to include your basic information , such as your name , age , gender and major , etc ."
neutral,I think the most important is that you need to show the employer that you are qualified for that job .
neutral,Would you like to copy the EX files and pass me the copy ? There are some figures I want to check .
neutral,Here is the copy . Do you need anything else ?
neutral,No problem .
neutral,"Hello , take a seat please . Let's get straight to the point . This is our contract . Please read it carefully before signing ."
neutral,May we once more remind you that the contract should be canceled by one month notice .
neutral,Is there anything I should do ?
neutral,"No , nothing . It's thoughtful of you to call me again ."
neutral,"Jack , I think it's best that I actively ask for the results of interview ."
neutral,"I think the letter of inquiry should be written briefly . If it's too long , I'm afraid the employer won't have time to read it ."
neutral,"After you send the letter of inquiry , you should pay close attention not to miss any reply ."

neutral,"OK , but I am going to look at the want ads in this newspaper first ."
neutral,"well , there is no doubt that many people have found jobs through the want ads in the newspaper ."
neutral,It is not very complicated . You can send your resume to the e-mail address of our company .
neutral,I am calling to inquire about the position of PR manager . What requirements does the job need ?
neutral,I've wanted to be involved in engineering ever since I was little . And my study has equipped me with a career as a mechanical engineer .
neutral,"Sure . The main courses I took included commercial accounting , cost accounting , industrial accounting , electronic accounting , and so on ."
neutral,What kind of work were you responsible for in the past employment ?
neutral,Great . We will give you a chance to have an interview in our company .
neutral,What are your responsibilities as a secretary ?
neutral,What courses did you take in English secretarial studies ?
neutral,"If a consumer complains about the quality of your products , what will you do ?"
neutral,Where did you work as a teacher before ?
neutral,What characteristics should an interpreter own ?
neutral,I think he should be an expert of everything .
neutral,"Yes , I have the Tour Guide Certificate ."
neutral,"Because your travel agency has a good fame in this market ; what's more , all the staff here are working very hard . I like doing some challenging job ."
neutral,Very short time . I became an auditor within three months .
neutral,I want to find a job in your bank as an accounting clerk .
neutral,What was your chief responsibility in your past work ?
neutral,Do you have any other questions ?
neutral,"Yes , may I ask something about the salary and benefits in your company ?"
neutral,That sounds fine .
neutral,All of you have reported your achievements . I'd like to remind you that we must be aware of the threat we face .
neutral,"The same with the previous speaker , we must know how things stand with us ."
neutral,"Yes , we must keep a clear mind with the tough competition ."
neutral,That's right .
neutral,A new reporter must expect to work many hours .
neutral,What are your salary expectations ?
neutral,"We ’ ll offer you a monthly salary to begin with , in addition , we offer one percent commission and all your sales . You also enjoy life insurance and health insurance . What ’ s starting salary would you expect here ?"
neutral,"Then , why do you want to work for our bank since it's a new establishment in Shanghai ?"
neutral,A meeting will be arranged to negotiate the relevant stuff .
neutral,That will be good .
neutral,"Hello.Is Bob there , please ?"
neutral,Hold on a second please . I'm sorry . He has gone out .
neutral,All right . I'll tell him when he comes back .
neutral,"Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days ."
neutral,Thank you .
neutral,I'd like to speak Dr.Johnson .
neutral,"No , I'm afraid I don't . Is it possible for me to see him now ?"
neutral,About half an hour .
neutral,"No , I have discussed the details about sales of our new equipment with the manager on the telephone yesterday ."
neutral,"Yes , I'll make a note of that and ask Mr.Li to confirm ."
neutral,"Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully ."
neutral,I see . I can tell Mr.Thomas that you phoned .
neutral,Have you ever helped others when they are in trouble ? Most will give a hand to someone who has helped him .
neutral,"Well , I will do it better ."
neutral,"If you want to ask for leave , you should get the approval from the manager in charge of your department ."
neutral,So remember to set your alarm clock .
neutral,How was Elvin ?
neutral,I can't wait to see the expression on her face when we dump her .
neutral,"To be honest , I'm starting to wonder if it's worth it ."
neutral,"OK , but don't tell anyone what I said ."
neutral,I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .
neutral,"No , it's unnecessary . Just respect the staff and their own opinions ."
neutral,"But sometimes they offer some useless proposals , it's awfully useless ."
neutral,That's right . I should speak to them in a polite way .
neutral,"Thank you . I'll try my best . By the way , when do you take over the new position ?"
neutral,"Not yet . To tell you the truth , I don't know how to write it . I've considered it for several days ."
neutral,So what items must be involved in this report ?
neutral,"And only that doesn't make a perfect one , you also have to pay attention to the format of the report ."
neutral,Thank you very much .
neutral,"I haven't been involved in international business , so I don't have any experiences , but I am diligent and I learn very fast ."
neutral,"Yes , in most circumstances.Are you available for business travel ?"
neutral,OK . You are good . Hope to see you next time . I'll call you if you get picked for next test .
neutral,I can see that . But I didn ’ t know you had experience in that line of work .
neutral,I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .
neutral,"OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay ."
neutral,6 . So we should give them special attention . Some of them don't have a good health .
neutral,"OK , I see . As far as you think , how many buses should we get for them ?"
neutral,I'll call the bus charter later . And have you announced the itinerary of this journey to all of them ?
neutral,"Well , uh ... I ’ m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ?"
neutral,Do you mind if I speak frankly ?
neutral,"Well . You see , I don ’ t like the office . I don ’ t like the staff . And I ’ m afraid of you . And I don ’ t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ?"
neutral,"Well , thank you . Mr.Parry , for all your information . Just one more question ."
neutral,"Yes , sir ?"
neutral,I was a runner-a long-distance runner .
neutral,"Certainly , sir ."
neutral,It ’ s time for me to go now .
neutral,"Bob , did you see our supervisor ? I need him to sign this paper ."
neutral,What kind of job are you looking for ?
neutral,Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel .
neutral,Wilson .
neutral,"Yes , It's Henrylee@yahoo.com ."
neutral,"I see . Well , consulting is a little different ."
neutral,How much commission do your consultants get ?
neutral,"Well , I'm very interested in the job ."
neutral,"Oh , yes . Arm , well , could you tell me your name , please ?"
neutral,"Very good , you can come here to work next month ."
neutral,"Well , how was the interview ?"
neutral,"Not too bad , I suppose ."
neutral,"Well , she asked me if my parents wanted me to be a steward ."
neutral,"Hello . Is Bob there , please ?"
neutral,Please tell him I'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon .
neutral,All right . I'll tell him when he comes back .
neutral,Did you ? And what did you study ?
neutral,I'm twenty-seven .
neutral,"Yes , I have worked in a bank for the last five years ."
neutral,"Mrcrabby , I ’ m pleased to see you ."
neutral,"Hold on a second , please . I'll see if he's in . I'm sorry , Mr.Baker had just gone out . Who's calling ?"
neutral,"Yes , certainly . What's that ?"
neutral,"Yes , certainly ."
neutral,How many words a minute ?
neutral,"Yes , on Monday ."
neutral,"Yes , that ’ s right , you have the job now ."
neutral,I will if you tell me how you're so sure that we're going to come out on top .
neutral,"Yes , I do . Everyone ."
neutral,"Oh , no , I ’ m student at a university , and I have to study most of the time . I can only work part time ."
neutral,Maybe . Maybe I will .
neutral,"If we let Vince and Elvin continue to run things , invoking is going to fail ."
neutral,"I'm saying this ship needs a new captain . Are you with me , or aren't you ?"
neutral,"I ’ d rather you didn ’ t , Miss Yang . I ’ m very busy now ."
neutral,Can I try later then ?
neutral,"Yes , of course ."
neutral,"Well , uh ... I ’ m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ?"
neutral,Do you mind if I sit down ?
neutral,"Don't worry about that , Dave . Look , I have to see Vince now . Think about what I said ."
neutral,I know how it works . You don't want to give away any more of your future profits than you have to .
neutral,Wilson .
neutral,How old are you ?
neutral,Where were you Bron ?
neutral,How much commission do your consultants get ?
neutral,Five percent .
neutral,One more thing . Would you give me a ten-dollar raise ?
neutral,Yes . We have an appointment at eight o ’ clock .
neutral,"Yes , arm , I'm 23 . I've been working abroad , I'm um ..."
neutral,"Where exactly have you been working , please ?"
neutral,Hey Lisa ... want to grab lunch with me ?
neutral,"Oh , I get it . Simply put , you're bored , huh ?"
neutral,I don't mind really.Perhaps a job in a shop or a factory .
neutral,"Well , I know Brown's Biscuit Factory are looking for a porter.They pay $ 200 a week ."
neutral,That sounds all right .
neutral,I'd like you to manage a new online auction site we're building .
neutral,"Elvin doesn't hold a grudge , if that's what you're worried about ."
neutral,"Hey , Ken ... I need to talk to you ."
neutral,Sure ... what's up ?
neutral,Can we step into the conference room ? This is a more private conversation .
neutral,"As I see it , he lacks the proper vision . His style is more about survival , and he's not taking the company anywhere.He ' s treading water instead of swimming ."
neutral,"Yes and no ... We can't ask for a show of hands on who thinks he should be fired , but we can introduce a vote of no confidence at the next board meeting ."
neutral,"When I was in LA , I met the WebTracker sales rep ."
neutral,The sales rep had a green note pad just like yours . He said everybody at WebTracker used them .
neutral,"We both may be snakes , Dave , but I'm just better at it . Among the snakes , I'm the sneakiest ."
neutral,Do you want to know what really motivates Vince to be nice to me ?
neutral,What about your accounts ?
neutral,I'm leaving him a message taped to my computer screen .
neutral,I had an idea .
neutral,My mind is made up .
neutral,Right . The faint of heart should not apply .
neutral,Is it true that one of our competitors is planning to launch their tracking service next month ?
neutral,"Vince . We're both busy , so I'm not going to beat around the bush . I need a raise ."
neutral,"and what if it doesn't work out , right ?"
neutral,How ?
neutral,That's why I promised that invoking would be up and running by the end of next week .
neutral,"So , you are leaving , aren't you ?"
neutral,Excuse me for taking your time .
neutral,It's nothing Navy .
neutral,"Well , I guess I could give you one more chance , but this is the last time.In themeantime , I hear that Tom who normally does night shift is taking three weeks ' vacation , Can you think of anyone who would be willing to work nights while he is gone ?"
neutral,I'd like to speak Dr.Johnson .
neutral,"Sorry , but he's not in . May I take a message for you ?"
neutral,"OK , I'll tell him ."
neutral,"Would you hold on a second , please ? Miss Cooper's extension is engaged ."
neutral,How long do you think she'll be ?
neutral,I'll need them for the conference on Monday afternoon.Do you think it can be done by then ?
neutral,"Thank you very much , Mr.James ."
neutral,"John , could you come to my office ? I need to talk to you ."
neutral,"Well , you're working very hard but not efficiently.And you don't work well with other employees ."
neutral,How about Friday afternoon ?
neutral,That'll be fine .
neutral,"Hi , Mary ."
neutral,Yes . I ’ Ve got a meeting in a minute .
neutral,Right . I ’ ll see you later .
neutral,Welcome to our company .
neutral,"Indeed , they are . Keeping staff happy is the only way to keep them with the company ."
neutral,"Frankly , some part of it I enjoy very much , but I prefer something more professional . It happens that I have a friend working here in this company . She told me the export department was to recruit an assistant . I felt very excited at this news . That's why I'm here ."
neutral,You said the same thing three months ago .
neutral,"To start with , may I know why you are interested in working for our company ?"
neutral,"First , as far as I know , your company has had an impressive growth record.Second , I want to get into the foreign trade business ."
neutral,"Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave ."
neutral,"Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients ."
neutral,Do you mind if I sit down ?
neutral,Not at all . Go ahead .
neutral,It looks like you guys work hard .
neutral,Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs .
neutral,Have you eve worked with tape recorders before ?
neutral,I used cassette recorders a lot when I studied English in high school .
neutral,How many hours would I work a day and what's the pay ?
neutral,"OK , I'll take it ."
neutral,"OK , but don't say I didn't warn you ."
neutral,"I learned from your ad.That you will provide on-the-job training for new employees.This is just what I need , because I'm a recent college graduate . I have the necessary knowledge and skills but I lack experience ."
neutral,"Quite good , I think . I came here by bus , and it took me about 15 minutes ."
neutral,"Yes , I'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics ."
neutral,"English , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy ."
neutral,"I like sports very much.Besides that , I also like working on a computer in my spare time ."
neutral,Good morning . My name is John Smith . I'm an import manager .
neutral,Yes . I had a look just now . I found some of the exhibits of excellent quality and beautiful design . I feel we
neutral,"OK . I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you.However , I think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay ."
neutral,"The steel sheets and bars come in , as you see , in different sizes and are unloaded onto the delivery bay here . We buy them in from a steel works in Wales . This is the new conveyor belt we installed last year . We doubled our output in this department as a result ."
neutral,"Oh , really ?"
neutral,If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off .
neutral,What would you suggest ?
neutral,The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go .
neutral,I think I can accept that .
neutral,Here's our sample room .
neutral,I was told that your company had been in the furniture industry for many years . What kinds of products do you generally handle ?
neutral,Yes . That's what we want .
neutral,I am sure we will make it up as soon as possible .
neutral,"No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French ."
neutral,The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm .
neutral,Do you like reading books ?
neutral,What do you think is the relationship between the subjects you've taken and the job you are seeking ?
neutral,Do you have any experience working with a computer ?
neutral,Do you have any other computer qualifications ?
neutral,What were you mean duties there ?
neutral,What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?
neutral,Because I ’ m very competent in this area .
neutral,"Yes , I would like to ."
neutral,Now please tell me something about your past work achievements .
neutral,Have you received any honors ?
neutral,Yes . I got the title of Advance Worker in 2006 .
neutral,Yes . I wrote a thesis entitled On Interpersonal Relations in the Socialist Market Economy and it was published in China Daily .
neutral,"If I ordered a desk today , how would it be before I got delivery in Scotland ?"
neutral,Do you want to get a promotion ?
neutral,"Yes , of course ."
neutral,"Mr . Smith , welcome to our factory ."
neutral,Do you have any different ideas ?
neutral,What's that ?
neutral,These drawings on the wall are process sheets .
neutral,I am sure we do have .
neutral,"Let me introduce myself , by the way , my name is Dick Brown ."
neutral,"Sorry , what was your last name again ?"
neutral,"Well , I'm not too happy about it ."
neutral,How do you do ?
neutral,I ’ ll see you then . Good bye .
neutral,I have good news for you.You ’ Ve got an interview . Can you come to the Human Resources Office on Thursday at 9 30 am ?
neutral,Where are you from ?
neutral,I'm from Germany .
neutral,"Yeah , but I can speak English , too ."
neutral,A little French .
neutral,But they wouldn't lay you off ! You are the most experienced project manager in the company .
neutral,Indeed . But let's stay in touch . I'll let you know how things go .
neutral,OK . Can you prepare things for the meeting in the meeting room ? Make enough copies of the handouts .
neutral,Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel .
neutral,That sounds fine . Please give me your name and phone numbers . I ’ ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . It will most likely be in a couple of days . Is it all right for you ?
neutral,Sure . He ’ ll get the bag . I think .
neutral,Not at all . Go ahead .
neutral,"I am , sir ."
neutral,Your major must be computer .
neutral,Do you think my educational background suits this position ?
neutral,"Generally speaking , training new members is usually necessary . We offer our new employees a one-week training course ."
neutral,Could you tell something about the job ?
neutral,"Oh , I see . I believe I can do the job well ."
neutral,Two . French and Spanish .
neutral,But the freight cost will be higher and that will affect the retail price .
neutral,"I am looking for a growth opportunity , which I feel is not available at my current employer . In terms of skills , I am Microsoft certified in Windows XP and several other operating systems ."
neutral,Could you do something to advance your shipment ?
neutral,May I know how long will it take to get some more in from the factory ?
neutral,Please find out the reason as soon as possible . We are in bad need of it .
neutral,"Ok , I am terribly sorry for the trouble you are getting into.We will contact you first thing , once we know the reason ."
neutral,Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly .
neutral,I made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . We should be able to get plenty of customers .
neutral,"Yes , because I think being interesting thing is the best teacher . Or have more opportunities to have career growth ."
neutral,"In 2004 , I got a job in the sales department of a trading company near Guangzhou . I started a sales representative . A year later , I was promoted to the position of sales manager . I had that job ever since , which is just over a year now ."
neutral,"I think I ’ m very good at planning . I manage my time perfectly , so that I can always get things done on time ."
neutral,"Yes , I work well under pressure and find it dimly . However , I believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines ."
neutral,Are you more a follower or a leader ?
neutral,Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you .
neutral,You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic .
neutral,"A :: Tim , please . Please be seated ."
neutral,"A :: So , Wily , you have been with IBM for two years , ready for change ?"
neutral,"B :: Well , I think I'm ready for new challenges ."
neutral,How do you think the report I wrote ?
neutral,Not bad . But there is more room for improvement .
neutral,And how do you like working for IBM ?
neutral,"I get along well with people , and I enjoy working with others ."
neutral,Here you are . Do you need glue ?
neutral,You need all your receipts for reimbursement .
neutral,You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ?
neutral,Let ’ s call it a day .
neutral,It ’ s hard to commute a long way .
neutral,Are you familiar with the office management ?
neutral,I have done something like that before .
neutral,I think I am . I left the job only because it was too far from my home .
neutral,Did you sign up for the picnic party ?
neutral,We need to know whether you have the special training .
neutral,"Yes , I need a job that can give full play to my skills ."
neutral,"Do you like a job in a library , working with books ?"
neutral,Sure . Any specific reason I should know about in case people ask where you are .
neutral,"Yes , I will need it . Thanks ."
neutral,You ’ re welcome .
neutral,"Thanks , Vivian ."
neutral,"Ok , shall I make a coffee first ?"
neutral,It is ok . My boss briefs me later on .
neutral,Was he unhappy with you not attending the meeting ?
neutral,Did you punch in ?
neutral,"Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ?"
neutral,I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him .
neutral,"I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow ."
neutral,What is your most preferred training method ?
neutral,"Well , I prefer active rather than passive training . For example , I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues ."
neutral,Have you heard that we will have reorganization ?
neutral,How do you think a manager should react to an employee ’ s unsatisfactory work ?
neutral,"Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other ."
neutral,"But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency ."
neutral,Have you thought about it seriously ?
neutral,Thanks . I had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
neutral,"Well , I work very long hours , ten hours a day is quite normal . And if something important comes up , I ’ m often in the office until 8 or 9 in the evening ."
neutral,"I am free on Tuesday afternoon from 2 PM to 4 PM , is it convenient for you ?"
neutral,"Yes , there is . See you then ."
neutral,You must be very busy these days . I heard you are responsible for the meeting arrangements this time . It can be the most important meeting for our company this year .
neutral,I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator .
neutral,"Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution ."
neutral,"Which job do you prefer , an accountant or a secretary ?"
neutral,"Neither , I prefer an active job ."
neutral,Then how about a salesman ?
neutral,Then I'll see you in the afternoon .
neutral,"Okay , I'm putting together a report on the Allied Marketing Co . failure , and I seem to have run into a stone wall . Can you help me out ?"
neutral,That works for me .
neutral,"Well , that's why you'r here.My source for big TV sets overcharged me on the last shipment , so I need someone new . I wanted to meet you to see if we can work together . I think"
neutral,"Fine , but before you agree , don't you need to know what you're agreeing to ?"
neutral,"Good , well , here's what I need from you . Are you ready ?"
neutral,I should take the taller one for the choice .
neutral,"Hello , Marsha . I'm great and you ?"
neutral,We're ready to place our Christmas order and we need a formal bid .
neutral,"ASAP , in writing of course ."
neutral,"Sure , who am I bidding against ?"
neutral,"Oh , mostly fiction , lots of romance , science fiction , biography , stuff like that ."
neutral,About two years now .
neutral,I'd like to make an appointment with Dr.Cooper.Could you arrange it for me ?
neutral,I'm afraid he's fully engaged.Could you make it another time ?
neutral,"Will you be free this afternoon , say from 3 to 4 ?"
neutral,"Tomorrow is my day off . I wonder if it's convenient to change our appointment from tomorrow to next Wednesday , still at the same time ."
neutral,I'm calling about you appointment.Mr.Smith has to cancel all his appointments because he's got something urgent to attend to .
neutral,Anytime except today.Please give him a call before you come .
neutral,"If you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ?"
neutral,"I'm sorry , I'm engaged at 2 p . m ."
neutral,I don't think I can manage this morning . I wonder if we could after the time of meeting to tomorrow afternoon .
neutral,I'll look out for you about 2 tomorrow afternoon .
neutral,All right.Thank you .
neutral,"Ok , see you 10 o'clock next Monday !"
neutral,Good morning . I'd like to speak to Peter . Chen Please .
neutral,You're right . They are spinning pretty fast . Aren't they getting dizzy ? What if they fall ...
neutral,No . He's so far away I can hardly see him ! Let's keep eating !
neutral,Can you turn the lazy Susan for me ? I want some more chicken .
neutral,Can I help you ?
neutral,Frans Smith ? I think you may have the wrong number .
neutral,"The accounts department , I think ."
neutral,"What is it ? Tell me ! Will it work for Lester , too ?"
neutral,"Other than the employees , our boss Jack invited some friends of the company ."
neutral,Yes . He usually replies immediately .
neutral,"Well , there are still some consolation prizes . We can go up to the front and pick them up ."
neutral,"... yes , but this one has an all-new buzz ."
neutral,"Okay , so ... To Whom It May Concern , I am writing ."
neutral,"Mmmm , maybe , but I'd play it safe and just finish with "" Yours Sincerely "" . That's more professional ."
neutral,Almost twenty years . We were the first total PR services company of our kind in California .
neutral,And this is your company's head office ?
neutral,That's not bad . How long have you been in PR ?
neutral,What is our time frame ?
neutral,It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case .
neutral,I've just got Bean's new brand image . Let's make a T-shirt line with these pics .
neutral,"Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify ."
neutral,Could I first ask about the remuneration package ?
neutral,"Okay Rebecca , well I think you ’ Ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ’ s talk a little bit about your weaknesses ."
neutral,"Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever ."
neutral,"Well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . Okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ?"
neutral,"Yes , please ."
neutral,Is everything okay ? You seem a bit preoccupied .
neutral,"Sure , it ’ s Josh O ’ Neil ."
neutral,Ms . Stevens will be with you momentarily . Can I offer you something to drink ?
neutral,"Well , I was just wondering . . . you see , I know I ’ Ve used up all my vacation days this year , but my sister is getting married , and the wedding is overseas , and , well . . ."
neutral,"Oh , actually , Tuesday ’ s no good . Sorry about that ."
neutral,"But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing theinternet , I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus ."
neutral,"Well , you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly , yours wasn't up to date , that ’ s probably what was causing your problems ."
neutral,"Yeah , try not to kick or hit the computer !"
neutral,Um yeah . Sorry about that .
neutral,Yes . I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .
neutral,Could you tell me why you want to quit ?
neutral,I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
neutral,Do you mind if I speak frankly ?
neutral,Yes . I'd delighted if you did .
neutral,OK . I need to think about that for a while .
neutral,"It's interesting , I like being an editor ."
neutral,"I'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . Most of the work is boring ."
neutral,Do you have any complaints ?
neutral,"Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him ."
neutral,I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .
neutral,"Yes , you're right . We have to equip our company with a network of workstations at every office as soon as possible ."
neutral,I got the message . I'm quiting .
neutral,"I hear what you're saying , and I wish there were something I could do ."
neutral,How do you do ?
neutral,"Just over 4 years now . Since this is your first day here , I'm sure you don't really know too much yet . Let me show you around , so you can introduce yourself to everyone ."
neutral,"Now let me show you around . This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over there is the sales department ."
neutral,Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs .
neutral,Do you have a moment ?
neutral,"Yes , we just got it and it is fabulous . Well , first you have to turn this switch on ."
neutral,Now press this button .
neutral,"Good morning , I ’ m Daniel . I ’ m applying for the positon of manager ."
neutral,Why would you like to work with us ?
neutral,Welcome to our company .
neutral,There are people everywhere . What's that girl doing ?
neutral,He is our accountant .
neutral,Do you have any questions about the job ?
neutral,Yes . Are there chances for employees to be transferred to overseas branches of the company ?

neutral,"Not really , so long as you follow all the regulations ."
neutral,"If you make mistakes in your job , you'll be fired . Is that right ?"
neutral,No . Everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . The most important thing is to be responsible for your work .

neutral,Ok . Let ’ s get to work on our advertising campaign .

neutral,That ’ s great idea . Do you have the email address of human resource managers at any banks ?
neutral,"We ’ re having a department meeting at 10 o ’ clock , ok ?"
neutral,Then send them a SMS on their cell phone .
neutral,I told her that she should call me back at my office number .
neutral,One more question . It looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . Do you have a calling card that I can use to get through to them ?
neutral,Well . I shouldn ’ t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ?
neutral,That's all right . I'm almost finished . Do you need my help ?
neutral,All right I'll read it soon .
neutral,But it's true .
neutral,"The company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company ID , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training ."
neutral,"Yes , that would be nice , would I have a tour guide to tour completely visit these places ?"
neutral,"What memo ? There haven't been any memos this whole week . I check my unbox every day , and I haven't seen anything ."
neutral,This should go out as an intra-office memorandum to all employees by this afternoon.Are you ready ?
neutral,"Yes , sir.Go ahead ."
neutral,"Sir , does this apply to intra-office communications only ? Or will it also restrict external communications ?"
neutral,"It should apply to all communications , not only in this office between employees , but also any outside communications ."
neutral,Here is the document you asked for this morning .
neutral,"Yes , my name is Max Richards . May I please speak to George Nelson ? I have already called several times . It seems I always catch him out of the office ."
neutral,"Certainly . Mr . Nelson can not take your call at the moment because he is away . He stepped out of the office for the whole afternoon and is not expected back until tomorrow morning . His schedule is very unpredictable at times , so the best way to reach him is to first make an appointment by email or text messaging ."

neutral,"Can you tell me what it's about ? I can make a note of it , so Mr . Nelson is aware and prepared when he returns your call ."
neutral,Do you have his card ? What's in his portfolio ? Which firm has he worked for in the past ?
neutral,"Ok , there is no cash advance anymore for short trips . You have to pay out of your own pocket , so save all the receipts from your business trip . And then attach them to your expense account . When you get back , our company will reimburse everything ."
neutral,"I see . What about the maximum purdy and rate , any change ?"
neutral,You ’ re welcome . Have a nice trip .

neutral,"Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later ."
neutral,Marketing Manager ’ s Office . Can I help you ?
neutral,"Sorry , he is out ."
neutral,We ’ ll have them worked out by this evening and let you have them tomorrow morning . Would you be free to come by then ?
neutral,Yes . I ’ ll be here tomorrow morning at 10 .
neutral,I ’ m sure you ’ ll find our price most favorable . Elsewhere prices for hardware have gone up tremendously in recent years . Our prices haven ’ t changed much .
neutral,Thank you very much .
neutral,That ’ s for sure . You ’ ll know our products better after the visit .
neutral,Not so good . Lots of complains .
neutral,That ’ ll be most helpful .
neutral,How much do you spend on development every year ?
neutral,What ’ s that building opposite us ?
neutral,There were some gaps in your report . Please be more sorrow .
neutral,"Yes , I overlooked some facts . I ’ ll be more sorrow ."
neutral,"As a rule we don ’ t allow any commission . But if the order is a substantial one , we ’ ll consider it ."
neutral,You need all your receipts for reimbursement .
neutral,You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ?
neutral,"40 hours a week , Monday to Friday , 9 AM to 5 PM with one hour lunch break every day .."
neutral,"Do I have to work on weekend ? If so , how do you pay for the overtime ?"
neutral,You ’ re welcome .
neutral,"Well , we all get Labour Day off as a holiday , the real purpose of the holiday is to remember all the people who do manual or other hard labor . It's to celebrate those who work doing what other people might not be willing to do . I think we ought to do something in honor of the common worker ."
neutral,"I call this meeting to order . Thank you all in attendance today , I know it's a busy day for you all . We have a lot of material to cover today . Did everyone get an agenda ?"
neutral,"I need a copy of the agenda . Also , may I suggest something ? I know we have many points to review today , but would it be possible to limit our meeting time to finish before four o'clock ? Many of us still have a mountain of work to do before the day's end ."
neutral,Give these sales figures a look . It's pretty depressing . We're way in the red this year . We can't afford to keep going like this for much longer .
neutral,"It's really too early to tell , but a lot is riding on the new products . If we don't do better after the product launch , we may have to go bankrupt ."
neutral,What's our target audience for this campaign ?
neutral,"This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two ."
neutral,What kind of promotional events are scheduled for the new product line ?
neutral,"Other than the marathon , what else is on the list ?"
neutral,"It might seem that way , but this events were all carefully chosen based on marketing research . These are the events that our customers and potential customers care about ."
neutral,How long will it take for our order to be delivered ?
neutral,"What are our areas for growth ? What sectors do you see the most potential in ? If we are going to pull our sales numbers up and develop the brand , we got to work across the board ."
neutral,"It's not just spreading out to new markets that we have to address . I think we'd better first pay attention to developing our brand in the markets we already have.We ' Ve reached the awareness level , but we haven't established customer loyalty . People know who we are , but they still don't trust in our brand ."
neutral,Why is the price so high ?
neutral,Model of computers aren't compatible ?
neutral,I guess you get what you pay for .
neutral,"How about the lunch break , Lucy ?"
neutral,"Welcome to ABC Company . We have been expecting you , please have a seat . I will call him ."
neutral,Thank you .
neutral,"Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point ."
neutral,"But remind you , there are some forbidden activities ."
neutral,What are they ? I ’ ll be careful .
neutral,"Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed ."
neutral,"Do you have an appointment , Mr . Liu ?"
neutral,I ’ ll make sure he gets the message .
neutral,"Sorry , we have two Smiths , Robert Smith and James Smith , which one would you like to speak to ?"
neutral,Shall we need at one fifteen this Thursday ?
neutral,"Fine , I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday ."
neutral,Thank you very much .
neutral,"I am very impressed by your resume . Therefore , I am very interested to know why you ’ re willing to leave your current company ."
neutral,"Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly ."
neutral,Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
neutral,"It is enough for today . Do you have any last question ? If not , thank you for taking your time to come to our interview ."
neutral,"You ’ re welcome . For the moment , I have no further questions . I got a good picture of the job and the company . All my questions have been answered . Thank you for your time ."
neutral,"Ok , it was very nice to talk with you and I look forward to your decision at your earliest convenience . Bye ."
neutral,Goodbye .
neutral,They are reports of our company .
neutral,"Can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ?"
neutral,"No problem , here you are ."
neutral,"This first one , I have a question ... This graph is marking the sales performance for our line of hair products , right ? Can this line be right ? It looks like our sales plummeted . I can't believe we did that poorly ... If I remember correctly , sales went down slightly , but not as dramatically as the graph shows ."
neutral,"Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?"
neutral,"Yes , it will print immediately ."
neutral,Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
neutral,"Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ?"
neutral,"Yes , it ’ s right ."
neutral,I didn ’ t pay attention to that . I will try to get the paper out .
neutral,"Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things ."
neutral,That ’ s not good for me at all.It ’ ll have to be another time .
neutral,That ’ s all right . Then see you on Friday afternoon .
neutral,"I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility ."
neutral,Other company rules also need your attention .
neutral,"Yes , it is ."
neutral,"Ok , please first fill in the form and return it to me . You can do it in the next door ."
neutral,Good question . But I will tell you when you pass the first two .
neutral,"I have no idea there was that great of deviation between the two venues ... To make our products sell , we have to take the target audience into account ."
neutral,"Yeah , but have you made an appointment ahead ?"
neutral,I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately .
neutral,"Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control ."
neutral,"We've got to put more buzz words into the page text , so it will pop up when people search about our kind of products ."
neutral,"Yeah , you're right . We've got to get the most popular phrases there ... How else can we boost site traffic ?"
neutral,"Le'Ban is the new kid on the block , it's amazing they've had such tremendous success so soon ... With them on the scene , the competition is outthrough ."
neutral,"First we have the airline tickets , which are $ 500 per person ; with four of us going , that's t $ 2,000 . For our accommodations , we're spending $ 80 a night , per room , for five days . That's another $ 800 ."
neutral,How did your company's fundraiser go ?
neutral,"In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause ."
neutral,"It's hard to say , because the branches are located in diversity different countries , cultural and social influences will definitely play a part in the success of the product in the various markets ."
neutral,Employee welfare ? What all does that include ?
neutral,"Yes , that ’ s right . From now on , whenever you have a question or concern regarding anything that happens during the work day , Ms . Cain will be your advocate . If you believe there is anything inappropriate or unfair in the management practices , the ombudsman will be the first person you seek . Her job is to have your best interest at heart ."
neutral,"Wow ... I thought he was early forty stops , why would he want to retire so soon ?"
neutral,What percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings ? I'm guessing not a large percentage ...
neutral,"You would like me to send this to all managerial staff ? I'm sorry , sir , could you please clarify ? Who all is included in managerial staff ?"
neutral,"No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased ."
neutral,"It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ?"
neutral,"Mr . White , too ."
neutral,"Mitsubishi , HP , IBM and many other famous corporations ."
neutral,How can I help you ?
neutral,Sure .
neutral,You know what we will get ?
neutral,What docking station ?
neutral,You mean the network connection ?
neutral,"Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ?"
neutral,"Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that ."
neutral,"Certainly , work always comes first ."
neutral,But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days .
neutral,You can send a compressed one .
neutral,It is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . It is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices .
neutral,Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done .
neutral,Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ?
neutral,"Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly ."
neutral,"No problem , here you are ."
neutral,"That ’ s normal after a tense work evening . Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . Once , I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later ."
neutral,"But if the company asks , what else can we do ?"
neutral,Shall we need at 1 fifteen this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
neutral,"Good morning . I ’ m Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . We have an appointment with Mr . Thomas ."
neutral,How long have you been in this company ?
neutral,I came two years ago after I graduated from college . This is my first job .
neutral,You must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college .
neutral,"It is so encouraging to hear this remark . The secret is to make plans . Write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . Then just work hard ."
neutral,"Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy ."
neutral,"I will call them this afternoon , thanks ."
neutral,That is very kind of you . Thank you very much .
neutral,What ’ s up ?
neutral,"Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year ."
neutral,This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ?
neutral,"I guess they must not have your contact information , so they sent it addressed in care of your department head . Anyhow , they wrote to confirm in writing what you discussed about the Milton contract ."
neutral,Can I see it for a second ?
neutral,"I don't think so , why do you ask ?"
neutral,"Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ?"
neutral,I think I can handle it by myself .
neutral,"I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility ."
neutral,Other company rules also need your attention .
neutral,Like this one ?
neutral,"Yeah , thank you for telling me ."
neutral,"Sure , what I can do for you ?"
neutral,"I'm try to write a letter to one of our clients , But I just don't know exactly what to say , I don't even know how to get started , I know I should write dear Mr . Mrs . or Ms . , but the problem is I don't know the name of contact person ."
neutral,"You can tell them "" Please finding the enclosed customer service survey , else also , you can say Attach a customer survey . If you need resource it right away , you can tell them the urgent by saying Please return the survey without dely as soon as possible . Maye it more polite with this as early as convenience ."
neutral,What was so bad about it ?
neutral,"According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day ."
neutral,Thank you for telling me that .
neutral,What are they ? I ’ ll be careful .
neutral,"I guess the fax machine is out of paper , too . Don't worry , I'll have someone look at it this afternoon , and in the meantime , I'll have your documents re-faxed to our other fax machine ."
neutral,"Yes , I would like to place an order for toner cartridges . We have a standing agreement with you company , so we will need the same amount as last time ."
neutral,Hello !
neutral,"Oh , I almost forgot . Thank you for calling to remind me . Actually . I do need to change the time of my appointment . I have a scheduling conflict . And I can't make it that early ."
neutral,That ’ s all right . Then see you on Friday afternoon .
neutral,"This is today ’ s schedule . At 8 thirty AM , conference with the department managers . At 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the staff for preventatives ."
neutral,That ’ s great . What are the prizes ?
neutral,3000 RIB as bonus for each person .
neutral,Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ?
neutral,And what is the most important point ?
neutral,I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there ’ s something wrong with the fax machine .
neutral,"I can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month ."
neutral,Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
neutral,"Mr . White , I would like to give you notice that I will be leaving the company . It will be effective at the beginning of the next month ."
neutral,"Oh . If you had talked to me first , we would have given you a raise ."
neutral,"Form your company's advertisement in the TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY , I learn that you are a foreign trade company of good service . I am interested in it.Here is my resume , ma'am ."
neutral,"Very good , you majored in International Trade ?"
neutral,"Of course , I'll try my best.When can I start working ?"
neutral,"Well , see you next monday ."
neutral,"Yes , on the shipper's side , when the cargos arrives , all relevant documents will be forwarded to the consignee.Among other things , this party has to check carefully the content of the packing list and weight list.When cargos are found to be damaged of short landed , this party has to call for a joint survey by representatives of the shipping company and the insurance agent.Based on the survey report , they will lodge a clam for compensation ."
neutral,If you act as our representative what would you do to safeguard our interest ?
neutral,Now can you tell me if you have a good command of both written and spoken English ?
neutral,"The conference room on the second floor , is that ok ?"
neutral,"Yes , I will see that the room is ready by Friday . And I will check there are enough chairs , and the lighting and air-conditioning are all right ."
neutral,"OK , but I think you should keep an eye on your plan if you see what I mean ."
neutral,"I know it ’ s so costly , but ..."
neutral,"Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ?"
neutral,No problem .
neutral,"Oh , actually , Tuesday ’ s no good . Sorry about that ."
neutral,"Well , um , sir , the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control . Look at these bills for example . Just this month we ’ Ve paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges !"
neutral,"OK , thank you . I ’ ll look into it ."
neutral,How would your coworkers describe you ?
neutral,"First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first .

neutral,"Tell me a little bit about yourself , please ."

neutral,Cheerfulness and friendliness .
neutral,"I admire a person who is honest , flexible and easy-going ."
neutral,How do you get along with others ?
neutral,I get on well with others .
neutral,Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ’ m really looking to settle down .
neutral,"Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining ."
neutral,"I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret.Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis ."
neutral,Do you have a cold ?
neutral,It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep .
neutral,"That bad , huh ?"
neutral,"Oh , come on ! I have sixteen items ! Cut me some slack , will ya ?"
neutral,"Darn ! Oh , well . I guess it ’ s just not my day . Thanks anyway ."
neutral,Will this be debit or credit ?
neutral,"No , I ’ m not trying to pass the buck here ; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done . But the thing is , I could have finished on time if the system hadn ’ t gone down . And you know , with everything I ’ Ve got going on now , I can ’ t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems . I ’ Ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day ..."

neutral,What sort of student do you regard yourself as ? Did you enjoy studying while you were at school ?
neutral,Have you ever had a job before ?
neutral,Good afternoon . May I help you ?
neutral,"Well , as I said they ’ re the industry leaders , they have a really great growth strategy , amazing development opportunities for employees , and it seems like they have strong corporate governance . They ’ re all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential . I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me . Oh , and they offer six weeks ’ vacation , stock options and bonuses ... I ’ m totally going to cash in on that ."
neutral,"Interesting . And , your postgraduate studies ?"
neutral,Interesting ...
neutral,"Sure , what ’ s up ?"
neutral,"Basically , I ’ Ve got a few concerns about him , and the bottom line is , I don ’ t think he ’ s a good fit for our company ."
neutral,"I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures ."
neutral,"You wanna take some time off , is that right ?"
neutral,"Well , sir , I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year ."
neutral,"What dates are you planning on taking off ? I ’ ll need at least two months notice , so that I can plan for your absence ."
neutral,"Mr . Smith , I's like to ask you a question ."
neutral,What are your salary expectations ?
neutral,"The starting monthly salary would be ¥ 2,000 , with rises after the half year according to your competence ."
neutral,We'll inform you of our final decision by early July . Do you have any other questions ?
neutral,What made you decide on this type of occupation ?
neutral,"Oh , to tell you the truth , I love the sky . When I was a child , I imagined flying into the blue sky some day . Now , I think the day has come . My dream will come true . And I like travelling very much and I enjoy working with people ."
neutral,"Yes , I think I am quite fluent in English . I got the certificate of the Secondary English Training last month ."
neutral,Are you in good health ?
neutral,"One of my strengths is my friendliness and open-minded attitude and also I think I have a warm personality . But sometimes , I find it is hard to tell others when I don't like what they are doing ."
neutral,I'll try to speak in another language or I'll try my best to use gestures and draw pictures .
neutral,Is Betty Sue in her office ?
neutral,"Yes , please tell her I stopped by ."
neutral,I think so .
neutral,"Of course . This balance sheet contains three major sections , that is , assets , liabilities and owner's equity . So , you see , the total current liabilities of your company are $ 3,372 , 000 , and the owner's equity is $ 5,400 , 000 . That means that the total assets , which is equal to the sum of the creditor's and the owner's equities , are $ 8,772 , 000 ."
neutral,The creditor's equity is the same as liabilities .
neutral,"Come in , please ."
neutral,"I forgot to include my experience as an accountant in my resume . In fact , I took a part-time job as an accountant at the Atlantic Trading Company during my second and third school year . I worked three evenings a week there and I did quite well . Here is the recommendation ."
neutral,"No problem . The professional English course is just English for Accounting . Moreover , as you know , the Atlantic Trading Company is a Sino-Australian joint venture . When I served part-time there , I became well acquainted with accounting operated in English ."
neutral,"No , can you tell me about it ?"
neutral,"Of course . As for an entry-level accountant , we pay ¥ 1,500 a month in the first half year . We have a grading system to evaluate your work . If you have made progress , we will certainly raise your salary . For beginners with a CPA certificate , they can earn at least ¥ 2 , 000 a month ."
neutral,Thank you . Good-bye .
neutral,"No , I know how to control my temper ."
neutral,"If you are hired , when can you start work ?"
neutral,Do you have a free moment ?
neutral,Then have you received any award at your present company ?
neutral,How would you evaluate the company you are with ?
neutral,"Although I could not say that everything is perfect there , I still very much appreciate what the company has given me , especial many chances ."
neutral,I don't want to have a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing .
neutral,I haven't thought it over at all .
neutral,"I learned to be patient when dealing with customers complaints and try my best to solve them . In addition , I learned at my previous jobs how to cooperate with my colleagues ."
neutral,"As I have some administrative experience from my last job , I may use my organizational and planning skills in the future ."
neutral,What do you think of this industry's outlook in five years ?
neutral,"My present pay is 100,000 Yuan per year ."
neutral,What are your salary expectations now ?
neutral,I think you'll find I'm worth that .
neutral,"Yes , it is quite reasonable ."
neutral,I know that generally it is possible to move from this position to a management position with two years experience in the company
neutral,That sounds very reasonable .
neutral,"Hey Ted , I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look ."
neutral,"Come on , what have you got to lose ?"
neutral,"Here , I ’ ll help you type one up ."
neutral,"My major was computer science when I was at college , and I am quite familiar with Visual C + + and Java language ."
neutral,"Yes , I have designed some programs for the network with Visual C + + and I have passed the test for programmers - MUSE ."
neutral,"Ok , I will contact you in a week . See you ."
neutral,Why don't you begin by telling me something about yourself ?
neutral,That right . One of my sisters is a doctor and the other one teaches at a university .
neutral,What made you decide to get into computers ?
neutral,"Yes , good morning . This is Mr . Suzuki from Video TV . May I speak to Mr . Johnson ?"
neutral,Tell him I telephoned . I'd like to see him about the videotapes . Can he call me this afternoon ?
neutral,"No , that's 447-9626 ."
neutral,Excuse me . May I see Mrs . Smith ?
neutral,It's me . What can I do for you ?
neutral,"How are you doing , Madam ? My name is During . I am coming to your company for an interview as requested ."
neutral,How old are you ?
neutral,"Yes , my birth date is September 22 , 1977 ."
neutral,Amalgamated Trading Company . It's Swiss . Don't you think working at a foreign company would be glamorous ?
neutral,But the competition is fierce this year ... and it seems like I'm the only one left who hasn't found a job .
neutral,"Not quite the only one . I really wanted that job at the magazine , but I still haven't heard from them ."
neutral,"Don ’ t worry . See where it says , “ New User ” ?"
neutral,Yes .
neutral,"Yeah , just fill out this form and choose a password . The computer will do the rest ."
neutral,"John , do you have a minute ?"
neutral,I ’ m not in there very often . It ’ s so noisy that I can ’ t work .
neutral,"No , not yet , but someone ’ s going to have to ."
neutral,Let ’ s rock n ’ roll .
neutral,"If you want my advice , you won ’ t invite yourself any risk ."
neutral,And I would say the logo is successful mainly because it comes from Japan.It is the Japanese that have made it a fad .
neutral,That might be true.But we have a logo concept that is great . It is really great . I think it will catch on in Taiwan at least . Young people will love it.It is because of our logo that our products will sell.We just need someone to produce the products for us.We have the backup and people to do the marketing .
neutral,"Yes , I want to know about the battle of Gettysburg ."
neutral,"Hello , this is Peter Dixon from NEZ news radio . May I speak to Mr . Wilson please ?"
neutral,"Yes , speaking ."
neutral,Do you have a cold ?
neutral,No . Worse than that . I have a flu . I'm in bed with a fever .
neutral,"Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ?"
neutral,Alright . Have you been to see a doctor ?
neutral,I'm not sure if that would be wise .
neutral,"Well , maybe we'll go to ask Mr . Johnson . He has the final say ."
neutral,Could I have a word with you ?
neutral,I am disappointed with your work lately .
neutral,What happened ?
neutral,I ’ m going to start taking classes at the local community college to try to improve my skills . Then I ’ ll start looking for a new position .
neutral,"Well , that sounds like it would be OK . Just be careful ."
neutral,Thank you . Bye .
neutral,I see by your resume that you have been working ?
neutral,"Tell me what you know about our company , please ."
neutral,Because I want to change my working environment and seek new challenges .
neutral,When can I get the final decision ?
neutral,"I was assigned a project to design a 360 - degree performance system . It was a challenge for a person with a finance background . I met with the technical people and discussed the possibilities and obstacles . Based on that information , I selected a team and created a spreadsheet to manage the project . We got the project done on schedule . I was rewarded for outstanding results and was able to share the honors with the team ."
neutral,What finance experience makes you qualified for this position ?
neutral,I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . I'd like to postpone that decision until later .
neutral,"I have 10 years financial industry experience , working for several companies . For the past two years , I have been working in an investment banking . In addition to my analytical mindset , I have a background of solid accounting principles . I am a team player and have great communication and interpersonal skills . I thrive on challenge and work well in high-stress environments ."
neutral,"One of my strengths is my ability to be flexible . I've seen companies go through many changes in structure and management philosophy . I've had to adjust my style to the new environment several times . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But by being aware of my tendency to overwork , I have learned to pace myself more and work less overtime ."
neutral,How would your boss describe you and your work style ?
neutral,I'm afraid I haven't had any experience in just this sort of work . I'm studying business administration in college . I want to get a job that would tie in with my studies .
neutral,"It's an interesting job , and your company is one of the best known . Although I have no work experience as a salesperson , the job description you sent was very interesting . It's a job I've been dreaming of when I was at university ."
neutral,Will traveling be required in this position ?
neutral,How often ?
neutral,Tell me about yourself .
neutral,Why do you want to work for our company ?
neutral,When can you begin ?
neutral,"To have a combination of technical and business knowledge and to be very results-oriented . My past record shows that I have those qualities and more . Because of my business acumen and technical know-how , the teams I have managed accomplished outstanding results , including booking more than $ 50 million in online revenue ."
neutral,Why did you leave your last position ?
neutral,What are your salary expectations ?
neutral,I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . I'd like to postpone that discussion until later .
neutral,"Oh , I'm sorry , Nigel . I'm rushing to a meet right now ."
neutral,"Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well ."
neutral,I have read your resume . I know you have worked for 3 years . Why did you choose to major in mechanical engineering ?
neutral,Many factors led me to major in mechanical engineering . The most important factor is I like tinkering with machines .
neutral,What do you think determines an employee's progress in a company such as ours ?
neutral,That sounds very good . How do you see your career development ?
neutral,Yes . Do you offer any opportunities for further study ?
neutral,"Yes . If you undertake additional courses , provided these are approved , and you complete them successfully , you can claim back part , quite a large part , 75 % of the costs you incurred . Not just the fees , - traveling and other expenses too ."
neutral,Why do you think you are qualified for this position ?
neutral,"I have four years study in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and it has given me a solid theory foundation . Moreover , I have worked at CAB Company for 4 years and got a lot of practical experience ."
neutral,Yes . Here it is .
neutral,I care about people and I know the importance of insurance .
neutral,Do you have any work experience in promotion ?
neutral,"Yes , I do . I have worked as a salesman for P & G Company Ltd ."

neutral,"May I ask who's calling , please ?"
neutral,Of course .
neutral,Could you tell me where the canteen is ?
neutral,"Sure , I can take you there actually ."
neutral,"Of course , Please hold the line Mr . Hunter ."
neutral,"Here , I ’ ll help you type one up ."
neutral,Thank you .
neutral,"How are you , Mr Wilson ? I am Tina ."
neutral,Do you have any other questions ?
neutral,But you know it's hard for a new graduate to find a god job right now .
neutral,"Oh , my . Why there are still so many things to learn after graduation ?"
neutral,"Good afternoon , Mr . Brown . My name is Mrs . Anderson , manager of the sales department ."
neutral,We are glad to hear that . What items are you particularly interested in ?
neutral,"May I see you around 10 o'clock tomorrow morning , please ?"
neutral,Don't worry . I'll be there right on time .
neutral,"This is Paula Blake , Mr . Simmons . How can I help you ?"
neutral,"Certainly , sir . Just tell me your account number please ."
neutral,What kind of job do you think I should get ?
neutral,Because that company's behavior is not in accordance with international law .
neutral,The numbers in this table don't seem to be in accord with reality .
neutral,When should I make my presence known ?
neutral,"The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ?"
neutral,I am glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation . I hope we can do business together .
neutral,Thank you for your inquiry . Would you tell us what quantity you require so that we can work out the offer ?
neutral,"What about the commission ? From European suppliers , I usually get a 3 to 5 % commission for my imports . It's the general practice ."
neutral,You see I do business on a commission basis . A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . Even 2 or 3 % would help .
neutral,What are you going to do now ?
neutral,"Yes , I did . But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in ."
neutral,"Hello , this is Mr . Morris Pitt . I'd like to speak to Mr . Bell , please ."
neutral,"Are you doing anything right now , Diana ?"
neutral,"Ok , I am coming ."
neutral,"Please take a seat , Diana . Have you got your spare pens and pencils ?"
neutral,"Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list ."
neutral,"Good afternoon , Mr . Black . Haven't seen you for a long time . Can I help you ?"
neutral,All right .
neutral,Is there anything else I can help you with ?
neutral,Thank you .
neutral,Is there anything you want to ask about ?
neutral,"Certainly . There'll be a good chance of that if you work for this company . Not right away , of course , but in a few years , after you learn more about our business , you may go overseas with a tour group . Any questions ?"
neutral,Good-bye .
neutral,"Liz , do you have a minute ?"
neutral,"Yes , of course . What is it ?"
neutral,"I think I will call the office to send someone to meet us , and escort that person to the nearest hospital without interrupting our trip ."
neutral,"If someone wants to find us , they can look at this floor plan.It shows where all the companies have their booths ."
neutral,Are you hungry ?
neutral,I can't see Cortex on this floor plan . Don't they have a booth here ?
neutral,That's what I was afraid of .
neutral,"It's not your fault , Yuri.But tell me . When will Ivan be able to get out there ?"
neutral,But sir ...
neutral,Are you serious ? Fighting ? But I didn't hear anything on the news .
neutral,An appointment ?
neutral,I see . He's usually here on Tuesday mornings ...
neutral,Would you like something to drink ?
neutral,I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .
neutral,What do you suggest ?
neutral,I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that .

neutral,"Could I speak to Mr Wood , please ?"
neutral,John eng
neutral,"I don't think the meet will go on much longer , should I ask him to call you when he is free ."

neutral,"Yeah , I ’ Ve been working so much overtime lately ."
neutral,What do you mean ?
neutral,"Oh , great , I saw a job ad outside your store . I am interested in the job advertised . I am coming to see if there is any opportunity available for me ."
neutral,"Now we really need some part-time workers.You see , our full-time staff knocks off at five pm , but now we hope to extend the hours to eight pm.We need some part-time shop assistants to work 3 hours a day from five pm to eight pm.But I am not sure if you are qualified for the job.Since most of our customers are foreign , competence of good communication in English is necessary here ."
neutral,Good.There is only thing to be settled.Ten RIB an hour is the maximum we can pay you.Is the rate of pay acceptable to you ?
neutral,How about next monday ?
neutral,That's fine.please call again later .
neutral,What is the telephone number there ?
neutral,"8826789 4 , extension to 208"
neutral,When will you reach there ?
neutral,What type of people do you work with most effectively ?
neutral,What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ?
neutral,"I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week ."
neutral,"Ok , then would you please hold the line ? Mr Li , the line is through , Mr Brown is ready answering the call , go ahead ."
neutral,"Thank you for your assistance , Mr Bush ."
neutral,"Kate , will you please make ten copies of this report ?"
neutral,"Oh , forget it then . Hey , I told you to put the files on the in tray , not on my desk ."
neutral,"Sure , what do you need ?"
neutral,Just a second . I'll go get some .
neutral,"Oh , I see . I am Jack White , Personnel Manager . Take a seat , please ."

neutral,"Davids who , we have 5 Davids in the office ."
neutral,"Oh , sorry , David Richton ."
neutral,Thank you .
neutral,"if you have a few minutes , I'd like to talk to you about my future at this company ."
neutral,let me just grab your file . How long have you worked for us now ?
neutral,I've worked here as a sales representative for about a year now .
neutral,one year already ? It's amazing how time flies like that . Are you enjoying your job ?
neutral,do you understand what duties that job would entail ?
neutral,I think he'll be back in about an hour at least .
neutral,"Well , may I leave a message ?"

neutral,"Yes , Mr . Michael ?"
neutral,You have to listen to what the client asks for . What you have just shown me is not at all in line with the client ’ s wishes .
neutral,Thanks . I can wait here .
neutral,Mr . Emory ? I ’ d appreciate it if you would look over these letters before you leave today .
neutral,"For the amount of work we do on the computer these days , the one we ’ re using is just too weak . We really need a higher model ."
neutral,"Certainly , sir . We can wait another day or two ."
neutral,That ’ s all right . I ’ ll be finished in a little while .
neutral,We ’ re going to need a lot of new stuff after the holidays . Let ’ s make a list .
neutral,"Well , to begin with , we ’ re going to have to get a new desk for you and I ’ d like to replace that old typewriter ."
neutral,All right . No problem . What ’ s your extension ?
neutral,No problem . Do you have any cash on you ? I don ’ t think I have enough .
neutral,Two boxes of transparencies for the over-head machines .
neutral,"Right . Look , why don ’ t we make a list of the problems we ’ re dealing with . It ’ ll be easier to work through them that way ."

neutral,"well , I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice ."
neutral,"I'm sorry to bring this up , but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ?"
neutral,"well , that's part of the problem . His probation period is up tomorrow and I don't think he's ready to pass ."
neutral,what seems to be the problem ?
neutral,I see . Not everyone is cut out to work in management .
neutral,I know . It'd be great if we could transfer him to a department where he doesn't have to work with people .
neutral,is there someone else I can talk to ?
neutral,I'd prefer to speak with Ms . Fonda .
neutral,that will be fine .
neutral,"hi , Isaiah . How are you ?"
neutral,fine . How ’ s your job going ?
neutral,I ’ Ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from Goldman Sachs .
neutral,where will those be located ?
neutral,we ’ re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow .
neutral,how's your new job going ?
neutral,"really well , thanks ."
neutral,"she's not bad . She's a bit bossy , but I'm sure I'll get used to her ."
neutral,would you rather have her or your old boss back ?
neutral,do you like working in teams ?
neutral,how's your job search going ?
neutral,I see . Have you found anything that you're interested in ?
neutral,I've only found a few openings in my field .
neutral,"that's a good idea . You have plenty of experience in the tourism industry , don't you ?"
neutral,"but it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do ."
neutral,that ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work .
neutral,"if you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money ."
neutral,"Hi there ! My name ’ s Terry Graham . You ’ re new around here , huh ?"
neutral,that's OK . Have you sent your CV out to anyone yet ?
neutral,"no , because I didn't know what I wanted to do ."
neutral,sounds interesting . Where did you get the idea ?
neutral,"as you know , table manners in China are quite different from those of Westerners ."
neutral,yes . this must be a huge difference .
neutral,I only started looking for a job a few days ago .
neutral,I just received a phone call for an interview next week .
neutral,"yeah , besides my personal introduction , what else should I prepare ?"
neutral,"I've considered that . I'll share an apartment with others to save the rent , and the cost of living won't be too much for only one person ."
neutral,"Yes . That ’ s why we have everything on computer files . We don ’ t use much paper at our office . After lunch , I had to deal with a complaint form a client ."
neutral,You certainly had a busy day .
neutral,"Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify ."
neutral,"Yes , of course . That's quite an important point , isn ’ t it ? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum . This doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance al"
neutral,I understand . And are there other bonuses included ?
neutral,"Excellent.Well , what other questions do you have Rebecca ?"
neutral,"Well , we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow , so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week . Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday . How does that so"
neutral,Absolutely . Thanks for coming Rebecca . Goodbye .
neutral,"Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ?"
neutral,"Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me ."
neutral,"Yes , that ’ s right . To be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . I was really just treated more like an intern . I didn ’ t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating ."
neutral,I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
neutral,"They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying two years there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really"
neutral,"that ’ s right . We ’ ll finish them just in time . The Macy project can wait for the time being . We need to spend several days on that project , but it isn ’ t due to be finished until the end of the month , s"
neutral,carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is up-to-date with their work .
neutral,I will . Enjoy your meeting !
neutral,so did i . I ran the ideas by a few people before the meeting and their ideas seemed to have the supports of some people .
neutral,so what happened in the meeting ?
neutral,go on . Take a chance . You could just hint at your idea . The client should be smart enough to take a hint .
neutral,"So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ?"
neutral,How can a business maximise revenues ?
neutral,Thanks . I need to make a few photocopies .
neutral,"The photocopier is near my office . Come on , I ’ ll show you where it is ."
neutral,We usually tell each other where we are with various clients and potential clients . The boss assigns extra duties to people who she thinks can best deal with them . It ’ s also a chance to put forward su
neutral,What ’ s your working day like ?
neutral,"My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ?"
neutral,"Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD ."
neutral,Has and advertising campaign been prepared ?
neutral,"Yes , it has . We ’ re going to target the business community through business magazines ."
neutral,I made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . We should be able to get plenty of customers .
neutral,Yes . Let ’ s say Tuesday at noon . Bring your portfolio with you .
neutral,"I know what you ’ re saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy ."
neutral,"Well , I don ’ t like it , but I guess I don ’ t have any choice ."
neutral,Nice to meet you . How can I help you ?
neutral,"Certainly , Mr . Murphy . Could you come to my office this afternoon at 2:30 ?"
neutral,"I know , but I want to make reservations this week ."
neutral,The most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides . Do you know all about them ?
neutral,"Yes , I've been observing them ."
neutral,I already have something to wear .
neutral,I have absolutely nothing so far .
neutral,Richard ? Do you have the number for that Chinese restaurant on the corner ?
neutral,I need to stay in the area because of my family .
neutral,"Sure . What do you need the most help with , the food or entertainment ?"
neutral,I think it should be casual .
neutral,Should we invite the whole committee or should we just have the sub-committee there ?
neutral,Very well then . Are mornings or afternoons best ?
neutral,"OK then , I will make the arrangements for them to attend . Do you know how to get there ?"
neutral,Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened .
neutral,Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home .
neutral,Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home .
neutral,Look around .
neutral,Not really .
neutral,They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage haj .
neutral,Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .
neutral,Are you watching another news report about the war ?
neutral,Yes . The two sides declared a short ceasefire but it broke down earlier today . Several military target were destroyed by bombing . Many civilians were among the dead and wounded .
neutral,Bout side claim a small area of territory . Both sides tried to build border fences and began attacking each other .
neutral,Why are you holding me in this jail cell ?
neutral,It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
neutral,several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end .
neutral,"So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a programme to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them ."
neutral,I also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines .
neutral,Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head .
neutral,"Good point . This is Sarah O ’ Connell reporting live from Washington D . C . , back to you , Tom ."
neutral,What's your name ?
neutral,Nigerian .
neutral,Where do you live in China ?
neutral,Tell me where it happened and how .
neutral,Do you remember when and where you last saw it ?
neutral,"I remember I saw when I was dining in the Aidan Restaurant . When I paid the bill , I saw it in my handbag ."
neutral,"Hello , police office ?"
neutral,It happened in the morning . I just came home from work and found the lock broken .
neutral,"OK , got it . Please don't worry sir . We will be there soon ."
neutral,"This is Action 5 News reporter Sarah O ’ Connell reporting live from Washington , D . C . where a protest has broken out . Thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed bailout of the auto manufacturing industry ! Sir , sir , Sarah O ’ Connell , Action 5 news . Can you tell us what ’ s happening ?"
neutral,"Good point . This is Sarah O ’ Connell reporting live from Washington D . C . , back to you , Tom ."
neutral,What was she wearing ?
neutral,She has a yellow dress on and red sneakers .
neutral,They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters .
neutral,"Oh , dear . Did you lose a lot of money ?"
neutral,Yes ?
neutral,Don't be too upset . It ’ s not the end of the world .
neutral,When did you find out ?
neutral,"About 12 o'clock , when I came home from work ."
neutral,He is so unskillful . I have never seen such an awkward burglar .
neutral,But we need the exact time . What time ?
neutral,Thanks for your help .
neutral,"OK , no problem . Have you found the blank ones ?"
neutral,"Yes , I have seen them ."
neutral,"Yes , well put your name on it after you have downloaded it off the company website . OK ?"
neutral,I will be available on Monday or Tuesday . Choose which day is best for you .
neutral,I prefer Monday .
neutral,Good . Can you come in the morning or would afternoon be best ?
neutral,Who would you like to see there ? Just the sub-committee or should we ask the whole committee ?
neutral,"Well , after you dial 9 on the keypad , you should hear the tone change ."
neutral,When you dial 9 and hear the tone change it means you have an outside line . Who are you trying to call ?
neutral,"No , I don't hear anything ."
neutral,OK . Now you dial 9 on the keypad . Do you hear the tone change ?
neutral,"All right , please take this message and call this client ."
neutral,Now does everyone understand the diagram on the board ?
neutral,My friend needed me to help him .
neutral,I appreciate you saying that and would like you to join us in our meeting .
neutral,That works for me . Let's see what we can each do about planning our part and meet again on Friday .
neutral,Any karks on his face ?
neutral,"No , I don't think so ."
neutral,"Boy , this surely doesn't help us much.It could be anybody.How about his cloth ? What was he wearing ."
neutral,Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head !
neutral,You're under arrest for concealing illegal drugs .
neutral,You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs . So we are taking you into custody .
neutral,What's your nationality ?
neutral,I would like to help you with both .
neutral,I don't remember .
neutral,"Yeah , you are right !"
neutral,My car broke down .
neutral,"Thank you , have a seat . We are working on the new project"
neutral,Yes it is . Think about it . If nobody paid any attention to anything then what's it all for anyway ?
neutral,Hang in there . The hardest part is just about over .

neutral,I like your positive attitude . How many years have you been employed here ?
neutral,I have worked here long time .
neutral,I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past .
neutral,I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process .
neutral,I can do either one .
neutral,Good . That would be very helpful . Can you start with those pages over there ?
neutral,I have been working here for 5 years .
neutral,"Well , if you could send me your basic background information before next Monday , it would be useful ."
neutral,Could I help you on your new project ?
neutral,That would be wonderful . Sometimes we will be working together and sometimes independently . Would that be OK ?
neutral,I am not sure yet .
neutral,I would enjoy helping with the writing portion .
neutral,"No , I can't be there ."
neutral,I need many things .
neutral,"I can get a few of them right away , but might have to order some ."
neutral,"I need ink cartridges , staples , and Post-its ."
neutral,How quickly will you need your supplies ?
neutral,We also will have to check your department budget . Do you know how much money you have for office supplies ?
neutral,Would you like these supplies delivered or would you like to pick them up ?
neutral,"With that understanding , you can figure out what your company is looking for in terms of basic attitude . Right ?"
neutral,I think that they are a very formal company .
neutral,I need a lot of help in this area .
neutral,"In addition to clothes we need to think about other basics , OK ?"
neutral,Can you work part-time or full-time ?
neutral,The binders have current local jobs listings and the computer jobs lists are good too . Understand ?
neutral,I want to work in a restaurant .
neutral,"We have lots of options , what type of job do you need ?"
neutral,I want to work in an office .
neutral,Do you want to work part-time or full-time ?
neutral,We have binders with local job listings or you can make use of the computers . OK ?
neutral,I am confused a bit but I am sure that I can figure it out .
neutral,We do not currently offer any retirement plan .
neutral,Do you reimburse for education that relates to my job ?
neutral,How about retirement ?
neutral,It's on the second floor in Suite 201 .
neutral,"Hello , I really appreciate the opportunity to interview for this position ."

neutral,"OK , well , that ’ s all I need to know for now . If something comes up , we ’ ll be contacting you ."
neutral,What kind of benefits does this job have ?
neutral,Do we have a 401K ?
neutral,"Unfortunately , our company is shutting down due to the economy ."
neutral,What is your biggest weakness ?
neutral,We have a position where that could work out well .
neutral,I need job security .
neutral,I am interested in switching fields .
neutral,"I have an interview tomorrow , so I hope I can learn everything quickly ."
neutral,"Right , and what about our friendliness and attitude ?"
neutral,Did you know that they pay as much attention to what you ask as to what you say in an interview ?
neutral,Why are you switching jobs at this point in your career ?
neutral,"When you get your next Continued Claim Form , you should just write down where you worked and note that you no longer need unemployment ."
neutral,I was trying to find the class on preparing for interviews .
neutral,"Yes , and I always feel much better when I am friendly ."
neutral,"Believe it or not , the interviewers are as interested in your questions as they are in your answers ."
neutral,"If I go there , will I be able to collect money right away ?"
neutral,You can search for jobs on the computers at the EDD offices .
neutral,What are the different workshops that are available at the EDD offices ?
neutral,Can you think of some other places where I may look for work ?
neutral,What comes next ?
neutral,It ’ s going to come together just fine . Trust me !

neutral,"That ’ s 545-8897 and your mailing address is 908 Mulbury Street . The zip code is 20310 , right ?"
neutral,"Yes , Mr . Emory ?"
neutral,"Just one moment , sir . Here you are – 767-4512 ."
neutral,When can you get the finished product to me ?
neutral,That ’ s right .
neutral,"Mr . Carmichael , this is Ellen Bower calling again . You had said I should call this week to schedule an interview with you ."
neutral,You may collect unemployment if you are working fewer hours or got laid off .
neutral,"It depends on how much you earned . When you file , they will determine the amount ."
neutral,You need to get a special application form .
neutral,You can go to the Employment Development Office and pick it up .
neutral,Be prepared to show a written notice of your termination as proof .
neutral,"You will receive a notice for a phone interview , which will continue the process ."
neutral,"Most jobs provide unemployment , but some don ’ t ."
neutral,Do you think that my job pays unemployment ?
neutral,"You can call your unemployment office , and they can check for you ."
neutral,Will I be able to collect a lot of money on unemployment ?
neutral,"Not all jobs pay into unemployment insurance , so their employees cannot collect benefits ."
neutral,How do I check out my status to collect unemployment ?
neutral,Where do I get the application form for unemployment benefits ?
neutral,You should be able to provide a layoff notice or proof of severance .
neutral,I think we should go over there and see if we can apply for that program .
neutral,Are there any other forms that I need to fill out ?
neutral,I am doing well . What ’ s up with you ?
neutral,"Hey there , how are you doing ?"
neutral,I am great . How are you ?
neutral,Will they send me a form telling me that I have been granted unemployment ?
neutral,One of the questions they ask you is if you were well enough to work .

neutral,"When I fill out the Continued Claim Form , what will I need to tell them ?"
neutral,Can I mail it in early next time so it isn ’ t late ?
neutral,"Yes , we can handle that here . How can I help you ?"
neutral,My paycheck that just arrived is less than last week ’ s check .
neutral,"Well , we deducted a portion of the income that you made from this week ’ s check ."
neutral,Can I mail it in late ?
neutral,"You can ’ t mail it in early because you don ’ t know , in advance , how much you will be working ."
neutral,I would be happy to answer any questions you might have .
neutral,I wouldn ’ t do that if I were you . There is a severe penalty if you get caught making false statements .
neutral,Did you generate any income during that time period ?
neutral,Did you mail us your last Continued Claim Form ?
neutral,Roger ? Would it be possible to meet with you to discuss my department ’ s budget ?
neutral,All right . That ’ ll be fine . Can you put together a rough idea of the kind of money I ’ ll have available for the next year ?
neutral,Certainly . I ’ Ve already worked out a general budget for all the departments .
neutral,"I hate to do this to you , Alice , but I ’ m going to have to ask you to put in some more overtime ."
neutral,"Fine , Mr . Emory . Would next Monday at 4:00 o ’ clock be all right for you ?"
neutral,"Let me take a look . All right , that ’ s no problem . See you then ."
neutral,"Well , I know you ’ re pretty booked up these days . But , we ’ Ve got to work fast on this ."
neutral,"I ’ ll need to meet with you before you go on vacation , Alex . I have a few things to clear up ."
neutral,"Oh , really ? Nice to meet you . I thought they were going to leave me here on my own ! How long have you been with the company ?"
neutral,"Does it ever ! Well , let ’ s get started . If you could begin typing this letter now , I ’ ll see what else needs to be done ."
neutral,"Hi , John Phillips ? I ’ m Rose Green . I ’ Ve been asked to handle your training and introduce a little bit of the company to you . It ’ s nice to meet you ."
neutral,"After a week , you ’ ll be running around here like a pro . Let me give you this list of departments first , next to each department is its location and the name of the manager ."
neutral,Excuse me . Mr . Emory ?
neutral,Absolutely . I ’ Ve been wanting to meet with you about that . Let me just get my book .
neutral,"Excuse me , Alex ?"
neutral,I was wondering if you could get together with me to go over the payroll .
neutral,I ’ d like to set a fixed time for this meeting before we finish today . Can you all take a look at your schedules ?
neutral,"Yeah , why don ’ t you do that , and then you can give me a call sometime next week ."
neutral,I do want to meet with you and take a look at your catalogue . We ’ re redecorating and are going to add some things .
neutral,Certainly . Mr . Graham . When would you like to meet ?
neutral,"Allan , I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project ."
neutral,The officer wouldn't lie about that .
neutral,There was no picture taken of your license plate ?
neutral,I don't believe it took my picture .
neutral,I appreciate that .
neutral,what happened to him ?
neutral,was it his first offence ?
neutral,"no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now ."
neutral,Why are you climbing through the window and not leaving by the front door ?
neutral,What happened next ?
neutral,Did he get caught ?
neutral,What can I do for you ?
neutral,"I feel that history is about to be made , and I want to be a part of it ."
neutral,"Yes , I am going to vote ."
neutral,I sent in an absentee ballot .
neutral,I have to work .
neutral,Okay . Wish me luck .
neutral,"Hello , welcome to IBA . What can I do for you ?"
neutral,What rental do you offer ?
neutral,"I'd like to get some details about a Personal Housing Loan , please ."
neutral,Is Ms April Wang available at the moment ?
neutral,"I hope so . I'm in the process of applying for a credit card with you , and Ms Wang asked me to drop off these documents ."
neutral,"IBA , Maria speaking . How can I help ?"
neutral,"Hello , I called earlier regarding interest rates on loans . Sorry , I just have a couple more questions ."
neutral,I'm here to help . Tell me your questions and I'll do my best to answer them .
neutral,"Hello , Mr Mayhew . How are you today ?"
neutral,I need some advice about my fixed deposits .
neutral,Yes ...
neutral,"There's information on deposit or loan rates , exchange rates ..."
neutral,"Ah , Jenny ! You remember me , what a good memory you have ."
neutral,"She's fine , thanks . Actually , she's the reason I'm here . It's our Wedding Anniversary in 2 weeks and I want to get her something special . She's been nagging me about our furniture , you see ."
neutral,How can you help me to decide which areas to invest in ?
neutral,Our Investment Financing Service will help you choose where to put your funds and look at both the pros and cons of each .
neutral,"Is this the information here ? Well , let's take a look then ..."
neutral,"Right , let me run through your options . You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to , but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan ."
neutral,"If it's this kind of consultancy service , I'll have to direct you to another department , I'm afraid ."
neutral,"I need some info on car loans . Such as payment periods , interest rates , things like that , please ."
neutral,Certainly . Do you currently bank with us ?
neutral,"Of course , the interest rates depend on what is announced at the time , but at the moment , the interest for a 2 - year loan is 5.29 %"
neutral,"We usually set up a direct debit system taking installments directly from your bank account on a monthly basis . And since you are already a valued customer , there should be no trouble in processing you application for this loan ."
neutral,I can ask for some advice from him .
neutral,"Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account ."
neutral,"Yes , I've had a Current Account with a debit card with you for years . Now , I'm looking at upgrading to a credit card ."
neutral,May I ask why you didn't think of applying for a credit card with us sooner ? Most young people jump at the chance .
neutral,"When I opened the account with you , I was a student , I graduated a couple of years ago and have a steady salary , so I figured now would be the best time to go ahead ."
neutral,"Well , the standard card has a lower credit limit , that's 20,000 RIB , whereas with the platinum card you can have a credit limit of 80,000 RIB ."
neutral,Why such a big difference ?
neutral,Morning . I'm a new user of your credit card and I was wondering if I'm taking full advantage of it .
neutral,You know it is not necessary to pay the balance in full every month .
neutral,"Yes . As long as you keep making regular monthly payments , paying the minimum is just fine . Of course , your credit limit will be lowered accordingly ."
neutral,Is there anything else ?
neutral,"If you put it on your card , you can get an overall statement that lists all of the transactions ."
neutral,"Hello Greg . Yes , that's correct . You see , we have just acquired a new partner , the transaction is huge . It's to be signed next month , and we would really like to have some clearer information about them ."
neutral,"That's right . I feel it's always better to go in with both eyes open , if you know what I mean ."
neutral,I couldn't agree more . If you have the company details with you I can get on with that right away . Is there anything else that you need from us today ?
neutral,"Welcome to the Consultancy Department , I'm Greg Wu . What can I assist you with today ?"
neutral,"I need to do a credit investigation on another company , but I'm worried it'll be a bit difficult ."
neutral,We are able to do credit investigations globally . You have no need to worry .
neutral,Certainly ...
neutral,"We will need detailed information regarding the full name of the company , the company address ..."
neutral,"And also , the bank and branch name the company holds an account with and the account number ."
neutral,"Yes , that's one of the main things we are interested in . When do you think I can get hold of this report ?"
neutral,"Good morning , Sir . Can I help you with something ?"
neutral,"Oh , I see , Sir . Well , it does take 5 working days to issue and post the card ."
neutral,Indeed . Is there anything I need to do before I collect it ?
neutral,"Not really . But we do recommend you to read through our terms and conditions again before you sign the card , just in case there is something you aren't happy with ."
neutral,"That will be sent on to you within 2 working days . Then , you can start using your new card ."
neutral,"I want to take out some money , but there's a massive queue for the ATM so I thought I'd do it over the counter ."
neutral,"I did that already , while I was waiting . Also , here's my card ."
neutral,"Please enter your personal code right here , on the key pad . And sign here , please ."
neutral,OK ...
neutral,Thank you . Here's your card back and your money . Please double check it for me .
neutral,"Good afternoon . This is Michelle Li speaking , calling on behalf of IBA . Is Mr Meng available at all ?"
neutral,"This is Mr Meng speaking , Michelle ."
neutral,"Oh , hello ! Sorry about that . I'm just calling to say that we've received your new Corporate Credit Card from HQ ."
neutral,"Yes , our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast-track system ."
neutral,"As long as you bring your ID , etc , we can serve you over the counter . But you won't be able to use the ATM until your new PIN number arrives ."
neutral,Good morning . Madam . What can I do for you today ?
neutral,What seems to be the problem ?
neutral,"Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ?"
neutral,It will show in your account straight away . Here's your card back and could you please sign the slip here ?
neutral,Welcome . What can I do for you this morning ?
neutral,I'm here on holiday and I don't have a local debit card . Is it possible to withdraw money on my Visa credit card here ?
neutral,Fine . Here you go .
neutral,"OK , 200 USD , please ."
neutral,"I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ?"
neutral,"We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies ."
neutral,"Yes , I've found a wonderful property I wish to buy . Unfortunately , I just don't have access to the cash ."
neutral,"That is good , it should speed things up nicely ."
neutral,"Then we can certainly help you with that . You see , for shorter term loans , we can offer an even more competitive interest rate ."
neutral,Mmmm ... that does sound interesting . Is there anyone available I can talk with about this in more detail ?
neutral,"That's great . You will need to make an initial down payment of 20 % , and then we can get going with this ."
neutral,"Not a problem . We offer a Personal Loan for Studying Abroad for anyone who's studying overseas , regardless of the circumstances . Anyone is eligible to apply"
neutral,Here it is .
neutral,"All right , here is your ballot card ."
neutral,Yes . What about you ?
neutral,I don ’ t know any of the laws they ’ re trying to pass .
neutral,That ’ s okay . They describe everything on the ballot .
neutral,I am . Are you ?
neutral,I don ’ t know how to vote .
neutral,Voting isn ’ t difficult .
neutral,They do ?
neutral,Of course ! Will you ?
neutral,I ’ m not sure what I ’ m doing .
neutral,The ballot gives you all that information .
neutral,Congratulations on being a part of history .
neutral,I knew he would win .
neutral,I think you have a point .
neutral,Is this the first time you ’ Ve voted ?
neutral,Why is that ?
neutral,Because you turned 18 in an election year .
neutral,I support our new President 100 % .
neutral,National Trust .
neutral,Certainly .
neutral,You know I did .
neutral,Don't worry ; I can help you with that . I understand that new technology can sometimes be unnerving . The first thing we need to do is check the ATM is in service . This one is fine .
neutral,"Yes , this one is in service . Put your card in here , in this slot and wait a moment . Then you will see some instructions on the screen ."
neutral,"Mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it , please ?"
neutral,"Maybe three times . As I said , I always forget it ."
neutral,"Oh , I see . So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me ?"

neutral,My wallet and my cell phone .
neutral,Were you able to get a look at this person's face ?
neutral,Would you be able to pick him out of a line-up ?
neutral,They made you spend the night at the station ?

neutral,Forex registration ?
neutral,"Good morning . I want to deposit 3,000 yuan in your bank ."
neutral,Yes . Do you have a savings account in our bank ?
neutral,"No , I haven't . It is the first time for me to come to deposit money here ."
neutral,"In that case , we'll just regard your account as a regular savings account from then on ."
neutral,"Yes , they are different because they are printed by the Ministry of Finance in set amounts . Just 100 RIB , 500 RIB and 1,000 RIB , you cannot choose from many amounts , you see ."
neutral,Good morning . Madam . How can I help ?
neutral,"Here it is . Could I make a balance enquiry , please ?"
neutral,"Yes , that's right . We want as much info as possible before we agree to anything ."
neutral,"Group companies can use this to make their arrangement of funds flexible , when dealing with their subsidiaries ."
neutral,"Ah , Hello . So , you are back ?"
neutral,That's good . Could I please see the originals of everything ?
neutral,What's the exchange rate today ?
neutral,"Hello , Mr Trent . What can I do for you this afternoon ?"
neutral,"Yes , of course . Well , let's get started . Would you show me your passport , please ?"
neutral,It's a little embarrassing really ; you see I think I've got a counterfeit note .
neutral,"Hello , how can I be of service ?"
neutral,"Well , it's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . So , unfortunately you'll lose this 50 RIB . We'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated ."
neutral,"I'm sorry but it is our regulation , so I must follow it . We will issue you with a receipt to show that the notes you presented us with are counterfeit and have been confiscated . Then , if you wish to pay in some more cash , you are free to do so ."
neutral,Yes . Please fill in a new deposit slip and we can continue .
neutral,"Hi . I want to open an account with you , so I can pay my bills by direct debit ."
neutral,Here you go . Is that it ?
neutral,Here . What's the least I can pay in to get this account open ?
neutral,"So , that's everything done for you . Here's your new cheque book , the cheque guarantee will follow in the post in a couple of days ."
neutral,"We have various different types of Current Deposit , the Variable Term Deposit , a Notice Deposit and the Usual Current Deposit . Which would you like ?"
neutral,"Arm ... just the usual , Current Deposit please ."
neutral,"OK , just a moment . I'll find the relevant data and help you with that ."
neutral,"Yes , right here ."
neutral,Here ? And here ?
neutral,"1,000 RIB ."
neutral,I'd like to withdraw some money from my account .
neutral,"Oh , I see . You have two choices here you can either redeem or renew ."
neutral,"No problem at all , Mr Waterstone . Any preference as to how you want the money ?"
neutral,"No , that's OK . I've got all of your information here on the screen in front of me . The money will be ready and waiting for you tomorrow ."
neutral,Good afternoon . What can I help you with today ?
neutral,"Yes , I know , but I need the money urgently for a family emergency , you see . I know I should apply in writing if I wish to withdraw , but I'm afraid there just isn't time ."
neutral,"I'm sorry , we cannot make corrections on these . You'll have to bring another one with the correct amount , I'm afraid ."
neutral,You can withdraw money from your account either over the counter or via the ATM .
neutral,"Actually , you only need to give 7 days notice if you wish to withdraw funds . Of course , you will lose some interest due to the withdrawal ."
neutral,"OK , I will have to take some details from you . Could you tell me your name , please ?"
neutral,"What I need you to do first is fill in these forms , with as much detail as possible . Then we can get you a new card ."
neutral,"So , I can get my new card today ?"
neutral,"Mr Moon , how good to see you again ."
neutral,What if I exceed ?
neutral,"Miao Ping , if I do decide to go ahead , how will the interest if I exceed be counted ?"
neutral,It is higher than the rate of interest for Current Deposits and a little lower than the rate for the 6 - month time deposits .
neutral,"I was told to come over to this window if I want to make a withdrawal . I'm not withdrawing from a Current Account , you see . I want to withdraw from my Certificate of Deposit ."
neutral,"Unfortunately , if you wish to withdraw on your C / D before the pre-decided date , you must give notice ."
neutral,"Yes , you will lose interest . I see that you have a 5 - year C / D with us . I'm sorry to tell you that would mean losing 6 months of interest as a penalty for withdrawing before maturity ."
neutral,"Well , the account's in my name . Patrick Dean , that's D-E-A-N . The account number is 15273478841 . There was about 20,000 RIB inside ."
neutral,Good idea . How much do I need to deposit ?
neutral,"With a Type B Account , it cannot be directly involved in any transaction and it cannot be applied to any external withdrawal service ."
neutral,Hello . I'm here today to pay in some foreign currency . Is that possible at this counter ?
neutral,"OK . We offer 2 types of saving systems , Time Savings and Demand Savings . With Time Savings your money cannot be withdrawn for a certain period of time , but with Demand Savings your money is ' on demand ' , you can withdraw at any time ."
neutral,Hello Mr Fang ! It's good to see you again . What can we do for you today ?
neutral,"Morning , Madam . This is the window for Foreign Exchange Savings . How can I help you ?"
neutral,That's fine . Is it a Time Deposit ?
neutral,Mmmm ... 2 years does seem like a long time . How about the interest if I save for 6 months ?
neutral,"That sounds fine to me . Yes , I think 6 months is the way to go ."
neutral,"OK , do you have the relevant materials ?"
neutral,We will go for the US dollar account .
neutral,"I see . That shouldn't be a problem , Sir . Which currency would you require ?"
neutral,Good afternoon . How can I help ?
neutral,"Yes , you can . Is that US dollars or HK dollars ? Both are available for exchange to RIB . How much would you like to exchange ?"
neutral,"Well , that depends . What's the rate like today ?"
neutral,"OK , well , I'm going to Europe . I guess 1,000 USD will be sufficient for now ."
neutral,"Kula Lumpur , in Malaysia ."
neutral,"With this agreement we can bring over you many benefits . For example , head offices of your group companies can get really prompt integrated fund transfers and centralised allocations . This helps internal supervision and admin run smoothly ."
neutral,"That's no problem . The amount is 2,000 RIB , is that correct ?"
neutral,"I've got the details here . 10,000 RIB sent by Mr CK Chen from Guangzhou . Could I see some ID ? You passport , for example ?"
neutral,"Yes , please . 70,000 US dollars is being transferred into our account ."
neutral,Good afternoon . Can I help you ?
neutral,Is it possible for me to buy some RIB at this counter ?
neutral,"Please fill in this exchange form , and I'll need to see your passport , and sign here . That's the money and your passport back . Of course , if you don't spend all of it , you can come back and we'd be happy to buy the local currency back from you ."
neutral,Hello . What can we do for you today ?
neutral,"Yes , I'm going to Europe on business and I need to purchase some Traveller's Cheques ."
neutral,"5,000 Euros will be sufficient , thanks ."
neutral,"Yes , I'm off again at the beginning of next week . I need to get some Traveller's Cheques ."
neutral,"Ah , hello . Do you have a service for buying Traveller's Cheques ?"
neutral,"We usually recommend our clients buy US Dollar Traveller's Cheques , as they can be exchanged for local currency all over the world . They are certainly the most versatile ."
neutral,"Oh , thank you . Yes , please . What I need is to handle some domestic affairs ."
neutral,"Oh , I see . In what area ?"
neutral,"Well , I need a Deposit Certification to handle this ."
neutral,"Yes , I'm afraid there is ."
neutral,"Hello , Sir . We haven't seen you for quite a while . So , what is it today that we can do for you ?"
neutral,"That shouldn't be a problem , Madam . I'm sure we can sort this out for you quickly ."
neutral,"Well , to be honest , it will slow things down a little . But it's not a big problem . You can do it by T / T ."
neutral,"Well , happy birthday . If it was sent yesterday using the usual service , it should be here already . You do have an account with us , right ?"
neutral,"Deutsche Bank . It was 25,000 US dollars ."
neutral,Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ?
neutral,That's not a problem .
neutral,Could you give me some details about that ?
neutral,"Hello , Sir . So , you are back ?"
neutral,"That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate ."
neutral,And I can purchase that here ?
neutral,"Yes , that's a Current-all-in-one Passbook . That's what you need to get your salary ."
neutral,"I'd like some info about your Payroll Services , please ."
neutral,"We can transfer the funds each month , at your request , into each employee's account . It is possible to pay in cash or to pay directly to the employee's savings account , no matter which bank they do business with ."
neutral,"Thanks for your advice , after going through all of these materials I've decided not to go with my initial choice ."
neutral,Yes . Is that necessary ?
neutral,Right . How about the Bearer Certificates ? Can they be cashed before the maturity date ?
neutral,"Unfortunately , not . You see , because they are not registered , they can be bought and sold by anyone . They also can be cashed on maturity in any nationwide financial institution ."
neutral,"Yes , of course . We have Treasury Notes with two , three and five-year terms available ."
neutral,"No , I'm afraid that isn't possible . You must wait until maturity before you cash them ."
neutral,"Fund info , the fund code , fund net value per unit , fund public info , fund account balance , fund trading conformation , daily details and the history . With our Net Banking , anything is possible !"
neutral,"OK , can I see the note and some ID , please ?"
neutral,"You do realise that you must pay a 0.2 % charge for premature cancellation , right ?"
neutral,Do you have any questions before you commit yourself to this ?
neutral,"I'm afraid so , yes . There is always some risk on the buyer's part ."
neutral,"First of all , you should open a Fund Account with us , just fill in this form . We'll need to see some ID and your Cash Card ."
neutral,That sounds simple enough . Do you charge any admin fees for that ?
neutral,Do you need any other documentation from me ?
neutral,May I help you ?
neutral,"About RIB 12,000 ."
neutral,"If you could show me your details , please . What can I do ?"
neutral,We can amend it for you as long as your customer agrees to the amendment .
neutral,"Yes , sir . How much would you like to remit ?"
neutral,No problem . Do you want the money to go by M / T or T / T ?
neutral,OK . I'll take T / T .
neutral,Bye-bye .
neutral,"OK , you can take that from my account . I'll fill in the form now ."
neutral,"Good afternoon , can I help you ?"
neutral,I'm Kristy . Can I help ?
neutral,"Oh , dear ! There isn't a problem , is there ?"
neutral,What else can I do for you today ?
neutral,"OK , just checking for you ... yes , they have arrived . How would you like me to handle them ?"
neutral,"Hi . Last month , our company , Turner Interiors of Beijing , ordered some documents under our new L / C . What I want to do is check and see if the documents have arrived yet ."
neutral,"IBA , how can I help ?"
neutral,"That was a wise decision , if I may say so . Our Personal Internet Banking Service offers online shopping transactions , payment of household bills online , account management ..."
neutral,"There is , actually . If you can get your company to apply for a cheque from a bank in Shanghai , that'll speed things up no end ."
neutral,I'm going to need some more info first . I was wondering about the repayments . How long would I have to pay back the loan ?
neutral,"Hello , Sir . Can I help you with anything ?"
neutral,"They are , yes . How should I do this ?"
neutral,"Yes , I've got that here ..."
neutral,"Let's get started . First , select the service you require . That's household bill payment for you . Then we select the type of bill , so that's landline ... here you go . Your bill for this month comes to 87.42 RIB . The money will come out of your account and go straight to the phone company ."
neutral,"Hello , there . Welcome , and what can we assist you with ?"
neutral,The ATM machine outside won't give me back my card .
neutral,The machine gives you three attempts to enter the correct code and after that it assumes that you are not the real owner and confiscates it .
neutral,"Yes , I can get it for you but I need to go back inside the bank ."
neutral,"Mr Ludlow , hello . It's good to see you again . What can we do for you today ?"
neutral,No problem . Could I please see the bill and all of the other documents ?
neutral,"Do I need to pay anything ? Like a handling fee , or something ?"
neutral,"I do , at a different location , I have a savings account and a CD ."
neutral,Here is my driver's license . Will that work ?
neutral,Business please . And I want the most simple one you have .
neutral,"Great . I shall also need a copy of your own ID and the Warrant Letter , you can fill in one here ."
neutral,"Hello , is everything alright ? Can I help ?"
neutral,"So , even if someone wasn't directly involved , they can become involved ? Like the bank you cash it in ?"
neutral,"Certainly , Madam . What would you like to know ?"
neutral,"Unfortunately , not ."
neutral,Hello . I'm Duty Manager today ; you wanted to speak to me ?
neutral,"Hello , I'm here to talk to someone about a Fixed Asset Loan ."
neutral,Yes . I also have a Loan Certificate .
neutral,"Well , we have no problems with our credit rating , I can assure you ."

neutral,"They're from Schnitt's of Rudesheim , Germany . Would you like us to check them ?"
neutral,What's the charge for that ?
neutral,It's 150 RIB for the service .
neutral,That seems pretty reasonable . Thanks .
neutral,I need to get a Letter of Credit . Is this the right window ?
neutral,That's done . There is more than enough to cover the contract amount in our account .
neutral,"Next , please ."
neutral,"It doesn't matter , but leave me some small changes , that will be convenient in daily life ."

neutral,It's DG193445782100 . Can you find it ?

neutral,Thank you very much .
neutral,It's my pleasure .
neutral,"I'll go back to the office and get it sorted and pop back later . Thanks , bye for now ."
neutral,Hello . I've been asked to come and see about something called L / C ? What is it exactly ?
neutral,"OK , to start , the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include Insurance Forms , Way Bills , Bills of Lading , Customs forms , various certificates ."
neutral,"Just that in effect , a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds ."
neutral,What seems to be the problem ?
neutral,"That's right , there's ' revocable ' and ' irrevocable ' . We usually go for the irrevocable one , it's the most popular ."
neutral,Okey . The interest rate for time deposit is higher . Could you tell me it's RIB deposit or currency deposit ?
neutral,"The term of time deposit ranges from three months to five years , including three months , six months , one year , two years , three years and five years . How long would you like to keep your deposit ?"
neutral,Here you are .
neutral,"Very carefully , that's when I found the problem ."
neutral,"It's not too bad today , actually . 828.23 ."
neutral,Hi . I need some help with these documents under L / C .
neutral,You will need to return the documents . That's no problem ; we can deal with that for you now .
neutral,Hi . You called and said I should come in . It's about some documents that have arrived for Nobut Foods .
neutral,Oh great ! We've been waiting for those . Is everything alright with them ?
neutral,"Well , we were contacted by your manager and he said ..."
neutral,"Yes , we talked about it and thought it was better and significantly quicker to ask the company to pay a Discrepancy Fee ."
neutral,"Yes , that's right . We have just introduced the program , but it's very popular already ."
neutral,"What if I don't want to come in to the branch , can I use the consultation service over the phone ?"
neutral,"Certainly , Sir . Via phone or Internet , any time , any place ."
neutral,"For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more . You see , in time deposit , the interest rate is 1.58 % after the 20 % interest tax . So , technically you could get more than a third more ."
neutral,"Good day . Welcome to IBA , what can I assist you with today ?"
neutral,"Hello , yes , I'm a stock investor and I'm looking at opening a new account with you . Perhaps your new compound savings one ? I already have a Current Account with you ."
neutral,"For every transaction you make , a statement will be drawn up and can be posted to you or sent via e-mail , or if you want to be double sure we can do both ."
neutral,"Hello , Madam . What can we do for you today ?"

neutral,"I've prepared some L / C documents , all in accordance with the conditions . There shouldn't be any problems ; I've done about a million of these things recently ."
neutral,I'm calling to let you know that the funds for NX567822100007 have arrived .
neutral,I know . I have an idea that we get together to discuss this next week .
neutral,Speaking .
neutral,"Yeah , exactly ! I bought them last year . En ... at present , they are still in good state ."
neutral,May I help you ?
neutral,What kinds of currency do you change ?
neutral,Could you tell me what the exchange rate for USD is today ?
neutral,What ? Where does that five come from ?
neutral,"Oh , it's a service charge ."
neutral,My husband said he had a credit card . Do you accept credit card ?
neutral,"Okay , here you are ."
neutral,"Yes , I want to deposit 1000 Yuan in my bank account ."
neutral,"No , that's fine . Do you bring your bankbook with you ?"
neutral,The deposit rate is 0.8 % every month .
neutral,Thanks .
neutral,OK ... Do I put on Magnolia Company for the receiver ?
neutral,Here you are . What is the rate ?
neutral,Generally it will arrive within a week .
neutral,I hope you'll try to convince them to step up production .
neutral,All right . I'll take you at your word . May I suggest that you put down in the contract shipment on October 15th or earlier ? Our letter of credit will be opened early September .
neutral,"We generally insure W . P . ( W . P . A ) on a C . I . F . offer . Special risks , such as TEND ( Theft , Pilferage and Non-delivery ) , leakage , breakage , oil , freshwater , etc . can also be covered upon request ."
neutral,"Yes , our delivery fee could be waived , if you make an order of 50 units or more . We would have to insist on the annual contract , however . I understand it's not the most convenient for you . Perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate ."
neutral,"What is it , Mrs . Wang ?"
neutral,"It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms . They reached us two weeks ago , and were immediately examined after they arrived . To our astonishment , about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms . We can't accept them in this state . They are unfit for human consumption . And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them ."
neutral,I am not sure . What's the rate today ?
neutral,It's 1 Australian dollar to 6.1 Yuan RIB .
neutral,The rate was 1 Australia dollar to 6.5 Yuan yesterday .
neutral,Let me think ... Will the rate still go down tomorrow ?
neutral,"When it comes to select a fund , you will always read Past performance is not an indication of future results , can you believe that ?"
neutral,"If you refuse to take risk , you can ’ t have better returns ."
neutral,I will think about it .
neutral,Everyone wants to be financial lose kill . You must invest your savings if you planed to retire rich . I ’ m thinking about buying stocks . It can be a good investment if I can manage well . What do you say ?
neutral,"I ’ m interested in all kinds of your products , but this time I would like to order some fireworks and mosquito coil incense . Please quote us C . I . F . Rangoon ."
neutral,All right . Here are our F . O . B . price lists . All the prices are subject to our final confirmation .
neutral,Discounts will more or less encourage us to make every effort to push sales of your products .
neutral,"The quantity you ordered is much smaller than those of others . If you can manage to boost it a bit , we ’ ll consider giving you a better discount ."
neutral,All right . See you tomorrow .
neutral,"Fine . Also , would you mind if I asked to see a surveyor ’ s report of your products ? I may have a few more questions about your quality analysis ."
neutral,"I understand that . If you can lower the price by 10 percent , we have a deal right now ."
neutral,No . These terms need to be amplified .
neutral,What if the sale is made on the basis of sight draft ?
neutral,"Well , we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ’ ll have to try , I suppose ."
neutral,We are interested in placing a large order for your wool carpet .
neutral,How much would you like ?
neutral,"Generally speaking , we provide bikes for both gentlemen and ladies , size 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 and 27 inches . We can vary the colors according to the buyer's requirements . Here are the catalogues and the pattern books . They will give you a rough idea about our products ."
neutral,Our representative in your country faxed a letter that you showed an interest in some of our products on display at the Oct . Exhibition there . Now we'd like to know if you have any specific requirements in mind .
neutral,That's true . I'm eager to know if you could send some fitters to ensure good operation .
neutral,"If you send fitters along with the machines to ensure that all the machines run properly , and if you provide after-sales service , we agree to make the payment in full ."
neutral,"If that's the case , there is nothing more to be said ."
neutral,I am sorry .
neutral,How's this then ? We propose partial shipment . We can ship whatever is ready to meet your urgent need instead of waiting for the whole lot to get ready .
neutral,We propose to deliver 50 % in June and the balance in Aug .
neutral,Do you quote CIF or FOB ?
neutral,You might consult your bank and see if you could reduce the required deposit to a minimum .
neutral,How many kinds of foreign invoices are there ?
neutral,"By Loco invoice , the price includes only the cost of goods at the warehouse of the seller . By FOB invoice , the price includes the cost before the cargo is delivered . By CIF invoice , the price includes all the expenses of cost freight and insurance . The price in Franco invoice includes all expenses to destination ."
neutral,No . What happened ?
neutral,"The City Bank . May I help you , sir ?"
neutral,I like both . Could you show me some samples ?
neutral,"Of course , here you are . These are Black tea from Anti , Oolong tea from Guangdong , Oolong tea from Fujisan and Longing tea from Xinu . The new products are Curls Black tea , Crushed Black tea and so on . They are the best sellers in many countries ."
neutral,"Yes . I want 500 kilograms of Black tea from Anti , 200 kilograms of Jasmine tea from Hangzhou and 100 kilograms of Crushed Black tea , first grade ."
neutral,"Good morning , Madam . Can I help you ?"
neutral,My name is Jenny Clinton .
neutral,Thank you . We'll inform you in time . Goodbye .
neutral,Thank you . I want to make a withdrawal of 150 dollars .
neutral,That's very expensive !
neutral,You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized .
neutral,Does the card provide any other benefits ?
neutral,"Hello , may I help you ?"
neutral,"Yes , I'll be happy to cash these for you . Would you please countersign them here ?"
neutral,Do we need to put on the jackets too ?
neutral,"You ’ d better , to protect your clothes . Now please watch your step ."
neutral,I see . How do you control the quality ?
neutral,What ’ s your usual percentage of rejects ?
neutral,How large is the plant ?
neutral,"Our associates specializing in these fields make some access - ries . Well , here we ’ re at the production shop . Shall we start with the assembly line ?"
neutral,That ’ s fine .
neutral,"It ’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . What ’ s your general impression , may I ask ?"
neutral,That ’ s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago .
neutral,Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature .
neutral,"Yes , a very pleasant journey , thank you ."
neutral,"That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ?"
neutral,Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products .
neutral,"Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us ."
neutral,"That is , your commission ."
neutral,"The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much ."
neutral,"Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details ."
neutral,"Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ?"
neutral,"Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction ."
neutral,"All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency ."
neutral,My friends in business circles all seem to be of the opinion that the U . S . import and export corporations have become more flexible in doing business recently .
neutral,How about tomorrow morning at 9 ?
neutral,"Good . I'll come back tomorrow , and we can then discuss it more specifically ."
neutral,We've received some similar comments from other Australian firms too .
neutral,"We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers . As you know , the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial . However , according to our records , the total amount of your order last year was moderate , which does not warrant an agency appointment . Unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent ."
neutral,"Let's put it this way . I propose a sole agency agreement for Ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of 3 years ; 60,000 pairs to be sold in the first year , 70,000 pairs in the second year , and 80,000 pairs in the third year , the area is to be within the continent of Australia ( excluding any neighboring island ) , commission 5 % ."
neutral,Tomorrow afternoon .
neutral,How much do you pay wholesale for your products ?
neutral,Retail price is 29.95 per unit . We take into consideration changes in supply cost when figuring this price .
neutral,"No , that's the price before tax . The tax rate is varies from different marketing areas , so it is difficult for us to figure in ."
neutral,Take your time .
neutral,How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ?
neutral,"To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken ."
neutral,"I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion ."
neutral,"Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ?"
neutral,what currency would you like to trade in ?
neutral,I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars . Do you accept $ 100 bills ?
neutral,"It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7.45RMB.If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7.35.Will that be all right ?"
neutral,"I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow !"
neutral,"Not too good , I'm sorry ."
neutral,So I didn't miss by much then .
neutral,Just give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units .
neutral,Please give me a few minute to calculate ... Our asking price should be about $ 100 per unit with an order of 100 . Is that price acceptable to you ?
neutral,"I understand . But unfortunately , it is our policy not to disclose our bottom line . You can be assured that price is a weighty consideration when we review the proposals . We also consider other elements , including design and practicality . We also give weight to the reputation of the submitting company ."
neutral,"Great ! And , how are things in your neck of the woods ?"
neutral,Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ?
neutral,"No , no , no , not at all.It ' s just that I've been looking forward to meeting you ."
neutral,"Please , I wish you would ."
neutral,"Well , as you probably know I buy from a selected group of suppliers and don't , as a rule , deal with new people ."
neutral,"No problem at all , Mike . Just give me the chance ."
neutral,"Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ?"
neutral,Sure . No problem .
neutral,It ’ s my pleasure .
neutral,"It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy , you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach ."
neutral,"Mumm , I estimate it'll run in the neighborhood of ... $ 500 per light ."
neutral,"Now , all this is available to you , as far as you make payment within a 30 day grace period . That shouldn't be a problem , right ?"
neutral,Great !
neutral,"Well , that might be acceptable , if you handle the insurance fees ."
neutral,But you'll have 90 days to pay your bill and I'll tell you what ... I'll also throw in the discount of 10 % on your up front deposit .
neutral,I think my husband has some .
neutral,"That ’ s true . If something happened to my husband , I might lose everything . Both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ’ s education . I can ’ t afford that by myself ."
neutral,Could we sit and look at the policy I mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ?
neutral,Can I use the FAS terms ?
neutral,Right ! So how do I do that ? What will make you happy ?
neutral,"So it's like you want me to be your eyes and ears into the industry . I can do that , provided the company I'm working for isn't hurt ."
neutral,"Well , Mrs . Wang , you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of cred it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er's guarantee . We always require L / C for our exports . And the other way round , we pay by L / C for our imports ."
neutral,"Well , just because it's you . Tomorrow , say around noon ."
neutral,"As to packaging , we'll pack them two dozens to one carton , gross weight about 25 kilos a carton ."
neutral,No problem . That can be done . I understand you'll ship the goods before the end of May ?
neutral,"Yes , we agreed to that . We have great confidence in your inspection institution . Through years of dealing with you , we've convinced of your commercial integrity ."
neutral,"Thank you . You can rest assured that we'll do everything possible to prevent de festive commodities from going abroad . However , if there should be any disputes , we wish to have them settled through friendly discussions ."
neutral,"Can you speed it up and let me have it today ? I'm leaving tomorrow . I've been here for almost a month now , you see . My corporation is urging me to return . I've booked the ticket for tomorrow afternoon's flight at 3 ."
neutral,Do you mean to say that I can open a letter of credit in yen with a bank in London or Bonn ?
neutral,A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered .
neutral,"By the way , Mrs . Wang , we have a mind to do joint participation with you on Japanese arts and crafts in our market . Would you entertain this proposal ?"
neutral,"Naturally , I appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of Japanese arts and crafts . But I'm not in a position to discuss your proposal today . I must first talk to our director , and discuss it with you some other time ."
neutral,"These are the various kinds of packing for pliers . Normally , we have three types of packing"
neutral,"Yes , we can pack the goods according to your instructions ."
neutral,"Very good . Ok , Mr . Brown , I'm now totally satisfied with your packing . You can execute our first order now , and I will open the L / C immediately after I return to Taipei ."
neutral,"Yes , of course . Assembly would be quite a simple matter . Cycle dealers could put them together in a very short time ."
neutral,Yes . What were they ? Anything that will help sales ?
neutral,"The Federal Food and Drug Administration , or the FDA as we call it for short , imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States . Over the years , they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers ."
neutral,"I'd be quite willing to if I could , but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law , or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the Customs ."
neutral,"Good . A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales . With competition from similar garments producers , the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive ."
neutral,"We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton , gross weight around 25 kilos a carton ."
neutral,"The cartons are comparatively light , and therefore easy to handle . They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo . The stevedores will see to that . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with straps . Silk blouses are not fragile goods . They can stand a lot of jolting ."
neutral,"No need to worry about that . The cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof , and as the boxes are made of cardboard , they will be handled with care ."
neutral,I can understand your position . Perhaps I'm asking too much .
neutral,Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ?
neutral,All right . We'll get in touch with our producers and see what they have to say .
neutral,"Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank ."
neutral,I ’ Ve been thinking of doing that lately ! I don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money !
neutral,It has just occurred to me that there is still another possibility to ensure a prompt delivery of the goods .
neutral,And that is ?
neutral,"I see . You want to have your goods shipped from New York to Osaka via Hong Kong , where they can be transshipped . Is that the idea ?"
neutral,Good morning . I ’ d like to ask some questions about your insurance policies .
neutral,In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ?
neutral,"If I have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? I ’ Ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months ."
neutral,"Next , please . May I help you , sir ?"
neutral,"I see , well , I think I ’ m more interested in a chequing account . I like to have easy access to my money ."
neutral,Yes . I'd like to open an account that enables me to draw money easily .
neutral,Sounds reasonable . Will 300 dollars be enough for a minimal deposit ?
neutral,I'd like to withdraw some money .
neutral,"Your ID card , please ."
neutral,I want 100 pounds . And here are 189 U . S . dollars .
neutral,Thank you . And goodbye .
neutral,"Hello , I'd like to open an account ."
neutral,OK . Here you are .
neutral,"I'd like to cash this check , please ."
neutral,"Well , I'd like to cash these four checks for $ 100 each ."
neutral,One thousand U . S . dollars .
neutral,One thousand U . S . Mm hmm . And are you going to pay cash ?
neutral,"Oh , no . I want to withdraw from my U . S . dollars savings account ."
neutral,Right . Here it is .
neutral,"Mm . In hundreds , please ."
neutral,"Actually , I'd like to open one of each , if that's possible ."
neutral,"Yes , I'd like to change some money to cover my expenses here . What's today's rate of US dollar against the RIB yuan ?"
neutral,"Okay , I want to change 22,000 ."
neutral,Could you please fill out this form ?
neutral,Thank you .
neutral,I need some US Dollars .
neutral,"Certainly , sir . How do you want it ?"
neutral,"You see , if you press this red button , the helmet becomes an umbrella ."
neutral,We're going to discuss how to market CB series soon . Does your project go well ?
neutral,"Oh , that's good ."
neutral,"I sometimes use traveller ’ s cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash ."
neutral,Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit .
neutral,That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain .
neutral,Yes . Could you tell me how to send some money to someone with an account with a bank in Germany ?
neutral,"Well , you can pay by mail , telegraphic or SWIFT transfer . Or you can have a banker's draft and mail it yourself to the beneficiary ."
neutral,How long does it take ?
neutral,Sure . You can have a Telegraphic or a SWIFT transfer .
neutral,"How do you use an ATM card , billy ?"
neutral,It's easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers .
neutral,"These machines aren't very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk ."
neutral,Yes . What's the buying rate for euro ?
neutral,"Hey , son , are you insured ?"
neutral,"Not yet , but I'm thinking of it . Have you bought one , Dad ?"
neutral,Can you tell me why you want to buy it ?
neutral,"You have children now . What if something , God forbid , happens to you ?"
neutral,"That's true . Well , how much do you think I should get ?"
neutral,It is . Our customers really like it . Do you have any other questions about your new accounts ?
neutral,The maximum is $ 1000 .
neutral,"Yes , but it's not much . You just have to pay 1 % interest on the account . It's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards ."
neutral,"They're all in order . If you just sign your name here , you'll receive your cards and pin numbers in the mail in about three weeks ."
neutral,You're welcome .
neutral,"Yes , speaking ."
neutral,"Let me get the asking price of the stock . Just a moment . Oh , now the asking price is $ 90 each share . By the way , what is the offering price ?"
neutral,Let me see . The offering price is near or at $ 88 .
neutral,"I heard that this stock would go up . Hum , I will take it at current price ."
neutral,"Yes , please ."
neutral,"Yes , I'd like to change these dollars , please ?"
neutral,"OK . How do you like your money , madam ?"
neutral,Would you like a savings or a chequing account ?
neutral,Right.Could you fill out this form please ?
neutral,This year our company is offering a new plan especially for single people like you . I think you might be interested .
neutral,It's hard to say . The stock market is weird . You never know what will happen tomorrow .
neutral,"It's a kind of investment . If I choose a good stock and hold it long enough , I can get good returns ."
neutral,"T / T , please ."
neutral,Let me just make sure . You want to withdraw one thousand dollars ?
neutral,"I have my passport with me , a driver ’ s license and a membership card . Will they do ?"
neutral,How would you like it ?
neutral,Let me see . I think maybe 600 USD at least .
neutral,But I am badly in need of the amount . Might I ask you to make an exception for me ?
neutral,OK . Here .
neutral,"Five tens , five fives and the rest in ones , please ."
neutral,"Let me see them . Yes , they're OK ."
neutral,I'd like to apply for a personal loan .
neutral,Our monthly interest is 1.5 % of the outstanding balance . Would you please fill out this application form ?
neutral,"Certainly . May I see your social security and your ID , please ."
neutral,"Oh , current accounts don't pay out interest ."
neutral,Fifty dollars . What is the exchange rate today ?
neutral,"Can I help you , Sir ?"
neutral,"Yes , I'd like to withdraw some money ."
neutral,How much do you need ?
neutral,"Yes , here you go ."
neutral,What amounts do you want the checks in ?
neutral,Here you are .
neutral,Is there anything else ?
neutral,"Yes , I'd like to know how to send money to France ."
neutral,"Thanks . Er , mister , if I want to deposit checks next time . what should I do ?"
neutral,Good morning . I'd like to cash this check .
neutral,Don't you have any other identification ?
neutral,Would you give me some in twenties and tens ?
neutral,All right . Please wait for a moment .
neutral,"Bill , I'm expecting a big increase in turnover with the coming of the Mid-Autumn Festival . But wholesales are unwilling to supply my orders unless I pay them an advance of 50 % of the full price , for my business is fairly new . I hope that you can make me an advance on loan ."
neutral,"Yes , I can . You know Mr . Macready , the famous car dealer here in New York . He agreed to act as my guarantor of a loan in the sum of US $ l0 , 000 until the end of this year ."
neutral,Do you want anything else ?
neutral,"Excuse me , is this the Auto Consumer Loan Center ?"
neutral,"You may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank , for example , payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments ."
neutral,Does that mean I should deposit sufficient money to my account prior to the monthly payment date so that you can directly deduct the repayment of the principal and interest ?
neutral,Anything else ?
neutral,What's the exchange rate for RIB ?
neutral,I've got a telegraphic order . Will you cash it ?
neutral,What currency will you have ?
neutral,"US dollars , please ."
neutral,"All right , and how will you have it ?"
neutral,"Um ... Hello , I would like to open an account ."
neutral,I will open it for you right now .
neutral,"Please write down your name , address and the amount of your deposit here . And please choose a passcode of six numbers and confirm it ."
neutral,Done ! What else should I do ?
neutral,Bye !
neutral,"Good morning , what can I do for you ?"
neutral,"200,000 yuan . By the way , what about the interest rate ?"
neutral,OK . Please fill out this loan application .
neutral,My pleasure .
neutral,How do you ensure quality ?
neutral,"Your satisfaction is guaranteed , or we refund your money ."
neutral,You will receive the tender notice next month and you'll find the information .
neutral,"I believe your corporation will try your best and I understand fully your feeling , if your tender conditions proved be suitable for our general conditions of tender , we will accept your submission of tender ."
neutral,"Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ?"
neutral,"Well , I want to draw out 4,000 yuan ."
neutral,Yes . Do I need to sign my name here ?
neutral,"Well , I want 1,000 yuan in traveler's checks and the rest in cash ."
neutral,"Oh , I am very sorry about that . It's our fault . I will arrange someone to correct it immediately ."
neutral,"What can I do for you , sir ?"
neutral,Please fill out this form .
neutral,"Let me check . Yes . Your 1,000 remittance , please ."
neutral,"Ok , please just fill out this form and show us your ID card ."
neutral,"OK , please fill in a Deposit Slip . All you need to do is to write the amount here and your name over here , on this line . I'll take care of the rest . First , could I see some ID ?"
neutral,"OK , how long does it need to be ? I'm not very good with remembering long numbers ."
neutral,O . K . We offer a few different kinds .
neutral,That would be our Saver's Plus account .
neutral,Thanks .
neutral,I like to open up a savings account please .
neutral,O . K . We offer a few different kinds .
neutral,That would be our Saver's Plus account .
neutral,"4.5 % , that's good . How much money do I have to keep in it to get that rate ?"
neutral,"Hey , daughter , let me ask you something ."
neutral,"Yes , dad ?"
neutral,"Yeah , I don ’ t mind it either . We ’ ll both end up rich slobs and not need it , but what if we do , you know ?"
neutral,Yeah . My grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive .
neutral,did you get the position you wanted ?
neutral,that's very nice of you to say so . I'll try my best . When will you start at the new position ?
neutral,"Next , please . May I help you , sir ?"
neutral,"Alright , then , with this chequing account you ’ ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . Will you require overdraft protection ? There is an extra fee for that ."
neutral,"If the goods are received in apparent good order and condition , the steamship company doesn ’ t have liability for pilferage . How do we protect ourselves ?"
neutral,Can you tell me which credit card it was for ?
neutral,The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed .
neutral,"Okay , thank you very much for your help ."
neutral,My Master Card .
neutral,"If that's the case , you will need to provide proof of their mistake ."
neutral,"How do you use an ATM card , Billy ?"
neutral,"It ’ s easy , grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . OK . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers ."
neutral,That ’ s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money .
neutral,That ’ s fine .
neutral,"If it is the post office's fault , may I have an extension on my bill ?"
neutral,I need to make a transfer .
neutral,Do you have a statement for your debit card ?
neutral,Which charges are you talking about ?
neutral,I would like to open another account .
neutral,You can always transfer money from that account into your new one .
neutral,I ’ ll do that right now .
neutral,Do you have a problem with your account ?
neutral,How may I help you ?
neutral,I ’ m having a problem .
neutral,Do you have the statement for your card ?
neutral,What are the charges you ’ re referring to ?
neutral,Thanks for everything .
neutral,Do you want cash back ?
neutral,Okay . Here you go .
neutral,I need to withdraw some money .
neutral,Thank you very much .
neutral,What can I help you with ?
neutral,I need to deposit $ 300 .
neutral,Deposit it into my checking account .
neutral,What else can I do for you today ?
neutral,I need $ 300 .
neutral,I would like to transfer $ 200 .
neutral,I need to transfer money .
neutral,How are you doing today ?
neutral,I ’ m fine .
neutral,You only have $ 57 left in your checking account .
neutral,Okay . Thanks . Have a nice day .
neutral,I thought I did .
neutral,I ’ m doing well .
neutral,Could you cancel a check for me ?
neutral,What were you supposed to write it out for ?
neutral,I wrote a check for $ 100 and it bounced .
neutral,That ’ s what my records show .
neutral,"No , you don't . We'll take care of it ."
neutral,What ’ s the problem ?
neutral,I have a problem with my credit card .
neutral,It's for a purse that cost $ 350 .
neutral,I can't even afford a purse that expensive .
neutral,I'm very sorry . When was this purchase made ?
neutral,The initial fee still must be paid .
neutral,I do apologize for that .
neutral,I see your problem .
neutral,It was a charge for a $ 350 purse that I never bought .
neutral,I think I would remember if I made a purchase that large .
neutral,I ’ m great . Thanks .
neutral,What do you need ?
neutral,"Actually , you do owe some fees ."
neutral,You need to pay these fees soon .
neutral,How are you ?
neutral,Cash or check ?
neutral,How are you doing today ?
neutral,Very well . Thank you .
neutral,I ’ ll be paying with cash .
neutral,I want a checking account .
neutral,What ’ ll happen if I don ’ t maintain that ?
neutral,How much is it ?
neutral,Is that all ?
neutral,What happens if I don ’ t meet that requirement ?
neutral,Do you already have an account with us ?
neutral,Do you want to transfer money from that account ?
neutral,How are things with you ?
neutral,I ’ m fine . Thank you .
neutral,How may I help you ?
neutral,I need to make a deposit .
neutral,It ’ s going to be $ 300 .
neutral,That ’ ll be all . Thank you very much .
neutral,Do you know the minimum balance you ’ re required to keep ?
neutral,You have to maintain a minimum balance of $ 100 .
neutral,"Yes , really ."
neutral,Would you like to ask any questions ?
neutral,I ’ m asking about overdraft fees .
neutral,The fee is $ 25 every time you overdraft .
neutral,How is that a small fee ?
neutral,I ’ ll say .
neutral,I don ’ t need to know anything else . Thank you .
neutral,What fees are you referring to ?
neutral,That ’ s not a small fee .
neutral,You owe $ 36.78 .
neutral,No cash today .
neutral,The total for all these items comes to $ 36.78 .
neutral,Take my VISA .
neutral,Put it on my VISA .
neutral,What ’ s wrong with it ?
neutral,I believe it was declined .
neutral,"So , why don ’ t you ?"
neutral,This will be my first time using an ATM .
neutral,Now what do I do ?
neutral,Then you need to type in your PIN .
neutral,I don ’ t understand .
neutral,Is there a problem with it ?
neutral,I don ’ t need it anymore .
neutral,What would you like to do with all the money in this account ?
neutral,I can do that .
neutral,That ’ s fine . Take your time .
neutral,What can I do for you ?
neutral,I only need one .
neutral,Would you like to make a withdrawal ?
neutral,Do you have any form of ID ?
neutral,"OK , just fill in this application . You can sit over there . This brochure explains our services . We have free checking , and you will be given a debit card and on ATM card . There is no service"
neutral,Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit .
neutral,That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain .
neutral,I took out a life insurance policy and made my wife the beneficiary .
neutral,That ’ a good idea . You are a fireman and it can be dangerous job .
neutral,I can terminate my life insurance policy when I retire and use the money as a pension .
neutral,"Even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money ."
neutral,I ’ Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ?
neutral,"The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM ."
neutral,Wait a minute ... do you have an account with us ?
neutral,Here you are Mr . Lee . Will there be anything else ?
neutral,"Right here , how can i help you today , sir ?"
neutral,"Yes , here is my account number ."
neutral,"Yes , it is the credit demand.Where can I cash travellers ' cheques ?"
neutral,It was alright . I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while.He ’ s in a bit of a jam .
neutral,Why ? What happened ?
neutral,"Well , his son had an accident and Bill doesn ’ t have health insurance . This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different HMO ’ s ."
neutral,"Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too ."
neutral,"Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money ."
neutral,"Well , we don ’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine ."
neutral,"Hey , John ! I haven ’ t seen you in ages ! What ’ s new ? What have you been up to ?"
neutral,Currencies .
neutral,What is it ?
neutral,"Well , the stock market just took a huge plunge and we ’ Ve lost a lot of money !"
neutral,"There are many factors that weigh in , but NASDAQ is down 200 points , the DOW JONES indicator also suffered ! Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth points week ago ."
neutral,I have to exchange some money .
neutral,that ’ s right . You ’ re going away next week .
neutral,"Well , that was an interesting documentary !"
neutral,Like what ?
neutral,That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ?
neutral,"Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank ."
neutral,I ’ Ve been thinking of doing that lately ! I don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money !
neutral,I have all the information in this folder .
neutral,"Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans ."
neutral,"That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan ."
neutral,"Our quoted price includes the software system , installation , 3 day training seminar and ongoing troubleshooting.There are no hidden costs ."
neutral,What if we purchase an increased quantity ? Can you give us better terms ?
neutral,I need to speak to an attorney regarding filing corporate govemance .
neutral,You would need to speak to Ms.Stevens .
neutral,"what ’ s wrong , Jim ?"
neutral,Couldn ’ d you choose to be transferred to a real person ?
neutral,Lately I've felt that company morale is at an all-time low what can your firm do to help get my business back on track ?
neutral,What a relief ! I was beginning to think it was no way to get my business rolling again .
neutral,"That's what we're here for , the human resources help you need , when and how you need it ."
neutral,"As I said , it is possible , but it would be much more expensive . I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system ."
neutral,"No , Ma'am . Installation isn't included.The price I quoted was just for the units ."
neutral,"Well , we don't usually do it , but ... I believe we can accommodate you on this.We will do the installation for free . Because we appreciate your business ."
neutral,Good . I hope we can arrange the contract as soon as possible .
neutral,Let me see them . Yes . There ’ re ok .
neutral,What ‘ s the minimum amount I can deposit in an account ?
neutral,"I went down to change some money , right ?"
neutral,I wanted to change around 5000 dollars . And you know the exchange rate .
neutral,"Yes , it's about 35 pesos for every Taiwan dollar , right ?"
neutral,"So , I went up to the teller and started to exchange the money . And it's true.They really gave me sixty pesos for the dollar ."
neutral,I ’ d like to withdraw some money from my account .
neutral,Sure ?
neutral,"Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t"
neutral,"Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff ."
neutral,No . But the contract stipulates that I will teach 22 hours a week.Will you have thatmany classes for me right away ?
neutral,I have a few questions about the free membership .
neutral,"That's right . So in a way , it is cheaper for you than for the members.You get more benefits than they do ."
neutral,Yes .
neutral,One dollar to five franc . Is that alright ?
neutral,10 o ’ clock in the morning to 2 o ’ clock in the afternoon .
neutral,But there is a big bonus for employees at the end of the probation period .
neutral,As well my company has been very supportive about my decision.They ' Ve cut back my working hours in order to accommodate my studies .
neutral,"Well , we've finally put the finishing touches on the training programs for next year . Here's a report showing the projected costs as well as the expected return on investment ."
neutral,A little of both . We'll have a few daylong sessions for things like business writing skills and software training . Those are available to everyone . We also have a variety of other programs
neutral,First and secondary research . I hope that you can address this concern immediately as i find it very disturbing .
neutral,As you know I ’ Ve been thinking about moving my career in a new direction . I am hoping that you will be able to provide me with a reference to help me jump-start my future .
neutral,You have done an excellent job this year and we are pleased with the results .
neutral,She freelanced with us for 3 years . She was always consistent and punctual with her assignments and a pleasure to work with .
neutral,She ’ s a consummate professional and a team-player . I have utmost confidence in her abilities . You can ’ t go wrong in hiring her .
neutral,Is there anything wrong ?
neutral,"We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard ."
neutral,yes . Does the checking account come with a debit card ?
neutral,Yes .
neutral,"Well . Obviously , you won ’ t want All Risks cover ."
neutral,"Well , thank you very much for all that information . Could you give me a quotation for my consignment now ?"
neutral,Yes . My customer is in urgent need of the steel plates .
neutral,"Ok , I'll get this rate right away ."

joy,"""Mistress widow,"" said the shirt-collar, ""little mistress widow, I feel quite warm."
joy,"""Yes, if I only knew a fresh one,"" said the old man, and nodded smilingly."
joy,"""Will not one knock soon?"" asked the boy; and the mother smiled while she put elder-tree blossoms into the teapot and poured boiling water over them."
joy,"He was an old, old sailor, and she his old wife; they had already great-grandchildren, and were soon to celebrate their golden wedding, but they could not remember the date, and the elder-tree mother was sitting in the tree and looked as pleased as this one here."
joy,"'Do you remember how we got our first boy, and then Mary, Niels, Peter, John, and Christian?' 'Oh yes; and now they have all grown up, and have become useful members of society, whom everybody cares for.'"
joy,"""Here it's agreeable in winter!"" said the little girl, and all the trees were covered with hoar-frost, so that they looked like white coral."
joy,The cloth which covered his face was lifted up; the dead man's face expressed peace- a sunbeam fell upon it.
joy,"How wonderful it is, that after all I have suffered, I am made something of at last; I am the luckiest person in the world- so strong and fine; and how white, and what a length!"
joy,"Then I had no attention, nor any water unless it rained; now, I am watched and taken care of."
joy,"""I never imagined anything like this,"" said the paper, ""when I was only a little blue flower, growing in the fields."
joy,Each time I think that the song is ended; and then something higher and better begins for me.
joy,"The pea-blossom pleased him most of all; she was white and red, graceful and slender, and belonged to those domestic maidens who have a pretty appearance, and can yet be useful in the kitchen."
joy,"Then he flew against the window-pane, and was seen and admired by those in the room, who caught him, and stuck him on a pin, in a box of curiosities."
joy,"Several of the guests could scarcely forbear laughing, and the sculptor would have had some difficulty in keeping his countenance, but the smile on his lips faded away; for he caught sight of a pair of dark-blue eyes close by the side of the inquisitive lady."
joy,"Charming!"" echoed from every voice."
joy,"And she nodded in such a friendly way at the company, that each imagined himself to be the favored person who was to accompany them to Italy."
joy,"Those deep-blue eyes, which had been lit up this evening in honor of him, must conceal treasures, treasures of heart and mind, richer than all the glories of Rome; and so when he left the party that night, he had lost it completely to the young lady."
joy,"The betrothed pair were very happy, and the mother was happy too."
joy,"""Ah, yes, you are always so polite,"" said mamma, with a smile; and Kaela silently pressed his hand, all soiled as it was with the clay."
joy,"Mamma-in-law acknowledged that Sophy was not only a clever housewife, but well-informed and accomplished, though that could hardly be expected in a person of her limited means."
joy,"Ding-dong! ding-dong!"""
joy,"She bent over her husband, who still slept; her warm, devoted kiss awakened him, and words of heartfelt love fell from the lips of both."
joy,"Now she was gentle and strong as a wife can be; and from her lips came the words of faith: ""Whatever He doeth is right and best."""
joy,"""But it is so delightful to swim about on the water,"" said the duckling, ""and so refreshing to feel it close over your head, while you dive down to the bottom."""
joy,"""See,"" cried the youngest, ""there is a new one;"" and the rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, ""There is another swan come; a new one has arrived."""
joy,This proposal was adopted by acclamation.
joy,"But in front of the tan-yard, close to the entrance, stood a little girl clothed in rags, very pretty to look at, with curly hair, and eyes so blue and clear that it was a pleasure to look into them."
joy,"""Oh, it is such a splendid and precious thing, that I cannot describe it,"" said the Mother-Toad."
joy,"""I writhed myself free,"" said the Caterpillar."
joy,Nothing is so beautiful as property.
joy,"""Yes, higher up,"" said the little Toad; ""higher-up!"
joy,"""What a good thing that I have not got it!"
joy,"Yes, I shall get to Egypt, for I feel so happy!"
joy,"""Amusement, too, is very beneficial."
joy,"And then they repeated the former joke about ""Portulak,"" and declared it was most amusing."
joy,"""This is really beautiful,"" said a young girl, who had come into the garden with a young man; and they both stood still near the Snow Man, and contemplated the glittering scene."
joy,"""Summer cannot show a more beautiful sight,"" she exclaimed, while her eyes sparkled."
joy,"The night was long, but did not appear so to the Snow Man, who stood there enjoying his own reflections, and crackling with the cold."
joy,"Brother, let you and I go to church, as your father and Anastasia's father once did."
joy,"Anastasia blushed like a young rose, and my mother kissed Aphtanides."
joy,"Let them bury the offenders out of sight, and keep their good temper."
joy,"""The man with a cheerful temper."""
joy,"In the forest the wonderful plant still continued to bloom till it grew and became almost a tree, and all the birds of passage bowed themselves before it."
joy,"The botanical professor wrote a long treatise about the heavenly plant, and for this he was loaded with gold, which improved the position of himself and his family."
joy,"The nightingale sang so sweetly that the tears came into the emperor's eyes, and then rolled down his cheeks, as her song became still more touching and went to every one's heart."
joy,"Three and thirty times did it sing the same tunes without being tired; the people would gladly have heard it again, but the emperor said the living nightingale ought to sing something."
joy,"But the music-master praised the bird in the highest degree, and even asserted that it was better than a real nightingale, not only in its dress and the beautiful diamonds, but also in its musical power."
joy,These are the jewels that rejoice a singer's heart.
joy,"""That's Paris, or some other great city, for they're all alike."
joy,"""A happy New Year,"" was the cry; ""a pretty wife, plenty of money, and no sorrow or care."""
joy,"""Now comes the young lady,"" said those in the carriage; and out stepped a young dame, delicate, proud, and pretty."
joy,"A land-owner followed, who in the month for sowing seed attended to the ploughing and was fond of field sports."
joy,"I went up to him, and took his hand, and said, 'Do you still feel the same for me?' 'Yes; ever and always,' said he."
joy,"'Will you, then, marry a maiden who honors and esteems you, although she cannot offer you her love? but that may come.' 'Yes, it will come,' said he; and we joined our hands together, and I went home to my mistress."
joy,"All the children were at school, and while they were sitting on the forms and learning their lessons, it sat on its thin green stalk and learnt from the sun and from its surroundings how kind God is, and it rejoiced that the song of the little lark expressed so sweetly and distinctly its own feelings."
joy,"""I can see and hear,"" it thought; ""the sun shines upon me, and the forest kisses me."
joy,"The little bird hopped round it and sang, ""How beautifully soft the grass is, and what a lovely little flower with its golden heart and silver dress is growing here."""
joy,"The daisy was glad that it was outside, and only a small flower- it felt very grateful."
joy,"Then he gathers a large handful of flowers, which he carries up to the Almighty, that they may bloom more brightly in heaven than they do on earth."
joy,"""Now we have flowers enough,"" said the child; but the angel only nodded, he did not fly upward to heaven."
joy,"This he would place over his head, and fancy that he was in the beech-wood while the sun shone, and the birds carolled gayly."
joy,"Then the Almighty pressed all the flowers to His heart; but He kissed the withered field-flower, and it received a voice."
joy,"""This is a wonderful place,"" said the goblin; ""I never expected such a thing."
joy,"At the window of one of them sat a little boy with fresh rosy cheeks, and clear sparkling eyes, who was very fond of the old house, in sunshine or in moonlight."
joy,"""Thank you for the tin soldier my little friend,"" said the old man, ""and thank you also for coming to see me."""
joy,"Then the old man came back with a pleasant face; and brought with him beautiful preserved fruits, as well as apples and nuts; and the little boy thought no more of the tin soldier."
joy,"You all stood looking very grave, although it was very difficult to do so, but I laughed so to myself that I fell down from the table, and got a bruise, which is there still; I know it was not right to laugh."
joy,"""Now I am in the house of God,"" she said, ""and in that house we are happy."""
joy,"""That is the most beautiful coat of arms in the world,"" said the old man."
joy,"He read, ""Greater love hath no man than this,"" and as he read a roseate hue spread over the cheeks of the queen, and her eyes became so enlightened and clear, that she saw from the leaves of the book a lovely rose spring forth, a type of Him who shed His blood on the cross."
joy,"""Very well; I promise."
joy,"However, he passed a very pleasant time; went to the theatre, drove in the king's garden, and gave a great deal of money to the poor, which was very good of him; he remembered what it had been in olden times to be without a shilling."
joy,"Now he was rich, had fine clothes, and many friends, who all declared he was a fine fellow and a real gentleman, and all this gratified him exceedingly."
joy,"""Hallo,"" said the soldier; ""well this is a pleasant tinderbox, if it brings me all I wish for."""
joy,"She said that an apple-branch was a most lovely object, and an emblem of spring in its most charming aspect."
joy,"""When it grows dark, and everybody is asleep, they jump about quite merrily."
joy,"How he will wonder what has become of them!"""
joy,"But to little Ida, all these stories which the student told her about the flowers, seemed very droll, and she thought over them a great deal."
joy,"But the flowers thanked her very much, and said,- ""We cannot live long."
joy,"This person, moreover, maintained that he belonged to a very old family in the land of Egypt, and that he was highly esteemed there."
joy,"""How beautiful existence is!"" said each rose."
joy,"How beautiful existence is!"""
joy,What a pleasure that must be!
joy,"But they were very pleased with it, and wondered whether all the little sparrows could become nightingales."
joy,"The windows of the house were broader at the bottom than at the top, and when the sparrows looked through them, every room appeared to them like a tulip with the brightest colours and shades."
joy,"All stood with enraptured faces round Thorwaldsen's grave, and a few picked up the fallen rose-leaves and preserved them."
joy,"""How glorious it is to live and to bloom, to see old friends again, and happy faces every day."
joy,Peep! how they have got on.
joy,"All that the boy had heard of Old Preben and his wife seemed clearly defined on the stone, and as he gazed on it, and glanced at the clear, bright moon shining in the pure air, it was as if the light of God's countenance beamed over His beautiful world."
joy,"The prince often looked with delight upon his gold and his magnificent edifices, and thought, like the crowd: ""What a mighty prince!"
joy,"""I am as valuable as any other corn,"" said he, ""and I am much handsomer; my flowers are as beautiful as the bloom of the apple blossom, and it is a pleasure to look at us."
joy,"Proudly and boldly he looked up, while the lightning flashed across the sky as if the whole world were in flames."
joy,"""The sun is so warm, I quite enjoy it."
joy,"And soon I shall go to sleep, and die as they call it, but I shall wake up with beautiful wings to fly with, like a butterfly."""
joy,"This linen holds the water together so beautifully, that my hind legs quiver as if I were going to swim."""
joy,"How charming this is for a mother, is it not Mr. Beetle?"" for she knew the stranger by his horny coat."
joy,"""Certainly,"" said the beetle, ""I shall be most happy; I have been exposed to the rain, and have had to lie upon linen, and cleanliness is a thing that greatly exhausts me; I have also pains in one of my wings from standing in the draught under a piece of broken crockery."
joy,"""There,"" she said, ""creep away, or fly, if thou canst."
joy,"It is a splendid thing to have thy liberty."""
joy,"The little one, with its bright eyes and golden hair, had been welcomed joyously on that dark November day."
joy,"He knew very well that he had enough inside him to buy up all the other toys, and this gave him a very good opinion of his own value."
joy,"""Yes, and a fine noise you make,"" thought the audience, as the play went on."
joy,"They all enjoyed the comedy so much, that they gave up all thoughts of the tea party, and only carried out their idea of intellectual amusement, which they called playing at men and women; and there was nothing wrong about it, for it was only play."
joy,"You walk together on the rampart in the fresh spring, on the high days and holidays, when all the world come out to walk upon the ramparts, and all the bells of the church steeples seem to be singing a song of praise for the coming spring."
joy,"When the princess with her ladies passed by and heard the tune, she stopped and looked quite pleased, for she also could play it- in fact, it was the only tune she could play, and she played it with one finger."
joy,That was a pleasure!
joy,The ladies danced and clapped their hands for joy.
joy,"""I have never heard a more beautiful composition."
joy,"Even if he ate me up stump, stalk, and all, and I had to dissolve in his body, it would be a happy death,"" said the cucumber."
joy,"With that the yard cock flapped his wings, made his comb swell up, and crowed again; and they all shuddered, the hens and the little chicks- but they were very proud that one of their number was such a champion of all cocks."
joy,"For on this day a son and heir has been born, and mother and child are doing well."
joy,"Everything invited to slumber, everything had a charming look of repose; and so the nurse had discovered, for she slept; and well she might sleep, while everything around her told of happiness and blessing."
joy,"""I must tell you,"" said she, ""that to-day is my birthday; and in honor of it I have been intrusted with a pair of goloshes, to introduce amongst mankind."
joy,"""Yes, this is East Street; how beautifully bright and gay it looks!"
joy,"It seemed to the little girl that she was sitting by a large iron stove, with polished brass feet and a brass ornament."
joy,The little boy said not a word; he was half pleased and half afraid.
joy,"As they passed from hall to hall, beauty everywhere showed itself; and as the Metal Pig went step by step from one picture to the other, the little boy could see it all plainly."
joy,"They are embracing each other, and one little one stretches out his hand towards another who stands below him, and points to himself, as if he were saying, ""I am going to heaven."""
joy,"The boy raised his hands towards the smiling children, and then the Pig ran off with him through the open vestibule."
joy,"Ib and Christina agreed together in everything; they divided their bread and berries when they were hungry; they were partners in digging their little gardens; they ran, and crept, and played about everywhere."
joy,"They floated on swiftly, for the tide was in their favor, passing over lakes, formed by the stream in its course; sometimes they seemed quite enclosed by reeds and water-plants, yet there was always room for them to pass out, although the old trees overhung the water and the old oaks stretched out their bare branches, as if they had turned up their sleeves and wished to show their knotty, naked arms."
joy,"They looked so inviting that the children could not help stopping; and they remained there so long eating, that their mouths and cheeks became quite black with the juice."
joy,"He could not utter a word; he could only seize her hand and hold it fast in his own, but he felt too happy and glad to open his lips."
joy,Then he kissed her lips; and so they parted.
joy,He understood the gypsy woman's meaning now.
joy,"Well, if it really is so, then the gypsy woman was right in her prophecy."""
joy,"""There's no place like home, even if it's a cellar."""
joy,It seemed to the bottle as if he were living that time over again.
joy,"""It must look very grand,"" thought he, ""for my wife to have a sentry guarding her nest."
joy,"They looked at Little Claus ploughing with his five horses, and he was so proud that he smacked his whip, and said, ""Gee-up, my five horses."""
joy,"The farmer's wife and the sexton were sitting at the table together; and she filled his glass, and helped him plenteously to fish, which appeared to be his favorite dish."
joy,"""Oh, I am not afraid."
joy,"""I may kiss him,"" she would say proudly, as she threw her arms round his neck; she was vain of her power over Anthony, for he would submit quietly and think nothing of it."
joy,"""God's will is the best,"" he would then say."
joy,All has happened for the best.
joy,In this way the memory of the kind lady dwelt in the calm mind of Anthony.
joy,"Then the old goblin said, ""Hold fast what you have: this hand is yours; for I will have you for a wife myself."""
joy,"""'Could I but have my love, Who then so happy as Glove!"
joy,"""Now comes the exciting part, little Anna."
joy,"We could hear her gentle breathing as she slept; gradually it became quieter and calmer, and on her countenance beamed happiness and peace."
joy,"It seemed as if I saw myself again in the days of my childhood; and so I voted for the hare."""
joy,"Tiny pleased him, and she was glad of it, for now the toad could not possibly reach her, and the country through which she sailed was beautiful, and the sun shone upon the water, till it glittered like liquid gold."
joy,What good fortune for a poor child like you.
joy,"As soon as he spied Tiny, he was delighted; and then she told him how unwilling she felt to marry the ugly mole, and to live always beneath the earth, and never to see the bright sun any more."
joy,"""Hei, houp! that was a ride!"
joy,"Here I come!"" shouted Jack the Dullard, and he sang till his voice echoed far and wide."
joy,"""Hurrah! it is quite famous."""
joy,"""Ah, that's lucky!"" exclaimed Jack the Dullard, ""for I suppose you'll let me roast my crow at the same time?"""
joy,"""I like that!"" said the Princess."
joy,"""That was very cleverly done,"" observed the Princess."
joy,"""While young, I can wander without a care, And build new houses everywhere; Fair and bright are my dreams of home, Always thought of wherever I roam."
joy,"The flag of the corporation fluttered before it, and the journeymen and apprentices shouted ""Hurrah."""
joy,There has been really more done for us than for any other creature; it is quite plain that we are the most noble people in the world.
joy,"""There can be nothing better than we have here,"" said the father-snail; ""I wish for nothing more."""
joy,"""'Now, let us have a dance,' said the fire-tongs; and then how they danced and stuck up one leg in the air."
joy,How we shine; what a light we give!'
joy,"As soon as the merchant's son had come down in his flying trunk to the wood after the fireworks, he thought, ""I will go back into the town now, and hear what they think of the entertainment."""
joy,"""He shall sing in the church, and stand among the beautiful gilded angels who are like him!"""
joy,"And his mother held him in her arms; she kissed his lips, his forehead, and his red hair."
joy,Charlotte blushed to guess at it.
joy,"""I've a remembrance of him now that will last."
joy,"""If I were to be dressed in a suit made of this cloth I should be able to find out which men in my empire were unfit for their places, and I could distinguish the clever from the stupid."
joy,"The emperor and all his barons then came to the hall; the swindlers held their arms up as if they held something in their hands and said: ""These are the trousers!"""
joy,"""Enjoy thine own bright life in the fresh air."""
joy,"For a moment the little ones stood silent with astonishment, and then they shouted for joy, till the room rang, and they danced merrily round the tree, while one present after another was taken from it."
joy,Then they pulled the horses out of the stable and rode off in rain and wind to obtain the assistance of friends.
joy,"But to-day the sun shines here- the warm, beautiful sun of God is within the little room; it comes from the south through the new window, where formerly the wall was."
joy,"""We must try to find out if it is!"""
joy,"You may have thousands of my days, but I have thousands of moments in which I can be merry and happy."
joy,"And the little creature danced and floated in the air, rejoicing in her delicate wings of gauze and velvet, rejoicing in the balmy breezes, laden with the fragrance of clover-fields and wild roses, elder-blossoms and honeysuckle, from the garden hedges, wild thyme, primroses, and mint, and the scent of all these was so strong that the perfume almost intoxicated the little fly."
joy,"Then it seemed as if new life was thrilling through every fibre of root and stem and leaf, rising even to the highest branches."
joy,"He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made bigger and bigger stitches."
joy,"In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were attracted and descended on it in hosts."
joy,"And the little tailor hastened to cut himself a girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: ""Seven at one stroke!"""
joy,"""What, the town!"" he continued, ""the whole world shall hear of it!"" and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb""s tail."
joy,"The road led him up a mountain, and when he had reached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking peacefully about him."
joy,"I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck."
joy,"They went and announced him to the king, and gave it as their opinion that if war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful man who ought on no account to be allowed to depart."
joy,"The counsel pleased the king, and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer him military service when he awoke."
joy,"Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord where the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received from both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man."
joy,"There the child fared well, ate sugar-cakes, and drank sweet milk, and her clothes were of gold, and the little angels played with her."
joy,"In the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly pearl."
joy,"The King put it in a box and rode away with it until he came to a deep piece of water; then he threw the box into it and thought, ""I have freed my daughter from her unlooked-for suitor."""
joy,"Then the watchman thanked him, and gave him as a reward two asses laden with gold, which followed him."
joy,"Once again the wife stood under the juniper-tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her heart leaped for joy, and she was so overcome with her happiness, that she fell on her knees."
joy,"Then she laid them in the green grass under the junipertree, and she had no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her, and she wept no more."
joy,"""My mother killed her little son; My father grieved when I was gone; My sister loved me best of all; She laid her kerchief over me, And took my bones that they might lie Underneath the juniper-tree Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!"""
joy,"""Bird,"" he said, ""how beautifully you sing!"""
joy,"Then he called his daughter and the children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red and green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two bright stars in its head."
joy,"Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!"""
joy,"Let me hear it too; sing it again."""
joy,"And when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with the chain in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone round his neck, he flew right away to his father""s house."
joy,My sister loved me best of all;
joy,"He went inside, and said, ""See, what a splendid bird that is; he has given me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself."""
joy,"The second said, ""My gift is, that gold pieces shall fall out of her mouth every time she speaks."""
joy,"So she got into the carriage and drove away with the King, and when they arrived at his palace, the wedding was celebrated with great pomp, as the little men had granted to the maiden."
joy,"Then the children went home together, and were heartily delighted, and if they have not died, they are living still."
joy,"The frog said, ""I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes; but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball again."""
joy,"As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could."
joy,"""Open the door, my princess dear, Open the door to thy true love here!"
joy,"Then he put his paws in through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they believed that all he said was true, and opened the door."
joy,"When the seven kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: ""The wolf is dead!"
joy,"The wolf is dead!"" and danced for joy round about the well with their mother."
joy,"""In milk I""m breaking bread so sweet, Will you be my guest, and eat?"""
joy,"""Sweep me the room as clean as you can, Up with the window, fling out my old man!"
joy,"For many a fine fat mouse he brought, Yet of his wife he never thought, But ate up every one he caught."""
joy,"Then an angel from heaven came to her and said: ""Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing, so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have."""
joy,"Then she went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time was come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness."
joy,"At length he said to the maiden: ""I will go home to my own country; if you will go with me, I will provide for you."""
joy,"Now the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire household should eat with him next day, and made a great feast."
joy,"In the meantime came the parson; the miller""s wife received him well, and said: ""My husband is out, so we will have a feast."""
joy,"""Oh, yes,"" said he, ""more than I could want."""
joy,"Then the peasants made up their minds that they too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the mayor said: ""I come first."""
joy,"And when he had looked at her for a long time, he said, ""Ah, wife! what a fine thing it is to be king!"
joy,"""Ah!"" said the man, as he gazed upon her, ""what a fine thing it is to be emperor!"""
joy,"""Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo her."""
joy,"After this still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they were all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like old Mr Fox."
joy,"""Now open the gates and doors all wide, And carry old Mr Fox outside."""
joy,"When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with malice, and said mockingly: ""I have them, they shall not escape me again!"""
joy,"Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable, and cried: ""Hansel, we are saved!"
joy,"But when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who so fascinated him that he forgot the maiden."
joy,"Then the little tailor stepped boldly forth and said, ""The princess has a silver and a golden hair on her head, and those are the two different colors."""
joy,"When the bear heard the music, he could not help beginning to dance, and when he had danced a while, the thing pleased him so well that he said to the little tailor, ""Hark you, is the fiddle heavy?"""
joy,"Quick, quick, help me out of my prison; if thou pushest back the bolt of this glass coffin, then I shall be free."""
joy,"Then she seated herself on a stone, ordered the young man to come to her, and after she had imprinted a friendly kiss on his lips, she said, ""My long-desired deliverer, kind Heaven has guided thee to me, and put an end to my sorrows."
joy,"The third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him so well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever in the craft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow, and said, ""Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit."""
joy,"Not knowing what better to do, he came into the plan, and learnt tailoring from the beginning; and when he left his master, he gave him a needle, and said, ""You can sew anything with this, be it as soft as an egg or as hard as steel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen."""
joy,"So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these, and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then reached the ship and got home safe."
joy,"And the king then gave to each half a kingdom, as he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and took good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the young lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have her again."
joy,"Then he wanted to go his way; but she took hold of him, and said, ""Listen, my friend, to what I am going to tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after a little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds sitting on a cloak."
joy,"Cut open the dead bird, take out its heart and keep it, and you will find a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise."
joy,"The huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, ""If all this does happen, it will be a fine thing for me."""
joy,"So the lady stole it away, and he never found any more gold under his pillow, for it lay now under the young lady""s, and the old woman took it away every morning; but he was so much in love that he never missed his prize."
joy,Then the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they might know him.
joy,"Come in and rest and let me give you something to eat and drink."""
joy,"So they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out the bread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them, were still unconsumed."
joy,"Then the king said, ""You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for your wife."""
joy,I brought you there because I really loved you.
joy,"""Then as you have spoken to me kindly, and are wise enough to seek for advice, I will tell you how and where to go."
joy,"Further on he came to a room where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him joyfully, and said, if he would set her free from the spell that bound her, the kingdom should be his, if he would come back in a year and marry her."
joy,"""He is still alive,"" said the huntsman; ""and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him go in peace, and brought home his royal coat."""
joy,"So he journeyed on, thinking of her all the way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was made of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the gate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with joy, and said he was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the kingdom."
joy,"When the first joy at their meeting was over, the princess told him she had heard of his father having forgiven him, and of his wish to have him home again: so, before his wedding with the princess, he went to visit his father, taking her with him."
joy,"And young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once on the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the sugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak."
joy,"He was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered fine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led to the outer chamber."
joy,"""Very well indeed,"" answered he; ""one night is past, the two others will pass likewise."""
joy,"Ah! now I know what it is to shudder!"""
joy,"""What a wonderful thing!"" said the king; ""I have seen many strange things, but such a monster as this I never saw."
joy,"When the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow, who was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went."
joy,"Here I discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws that control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the healing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of precious stones."
joy,"Then the other answered, as if very unwillingly, ""A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou wilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an hour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown to me."""
joy,"""How is it with thee, friend?"" said he, ""dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee?"
joy,"""Kate!"
joy,"So she took her time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried out, ""There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as carefully as you please."""
joy,"So when Frederick and Catherine came down, there they found all their money safe and sound."
joy,"""Yes,"" said Hans."
joy,"When it was open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried away."
joy,"Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it was not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that snorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind them followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and their swords flashed in the sun."
joy,"All that he asked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse."
joy,"The king""s daughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none of them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away."
joy,"Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and he did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it."
joy,"""My father is a mighty king, and gold have I in plenty as great as I require."""
joy,"This pleased the Lord, and he went in."
joy,"""With all my heart,"" he answered, ""I will go and offer it to him;"" and he went to the stranger and invited him, if he had no objection, to sleep in their bed and rest his limbs properly."
joy,"Then the man said, ""What else should I wish for but eternal happiness, and that we two, as long as we live, may be healthy and have every day our daily bread; for the third wish, I do not know what to have."""
joy,"So he got nothing by it but vexation, trouble, abuse, and the loss of his horse; but the poor people lived happily, quietly, and piously until their happy death."
joy,"The next morning she asked the way she was to go, and took leave of her father, and went forth with a bold heart into the wood."
joy,"But she told them how happy she was, and stayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood."
joy,"But as she sat she bethought herself of the egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it, there ran out a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold, that played about, and then nestled under the old one""s wings, so as to form the most beautiful sight in the world."
joy,"There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that, was quite happy and thought: ""You certainly are a pretty girl!"""
joy,"So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the one chicken in great glee."
joy,"However, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, ""I will help you; lie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be dead."""
joy,"""Thou shalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of."""
joy,"""Good day, Gretel."""
joy,Gretel presents Hans with a young goat.
joy,"""Good day, Hans, What good thing do you bring?"""
joy,"""Goodbye, Hans."""
joy,"What good thing do you bring?"""
joy,"""Good evening, Hans."
joy,"At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about his son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than before."
joy,"Then all who heard this rejoiced, and the lord of the castle said he would adopt him as a son if he accomplished it successfully."
joy,"The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth heard no more; they had disappeared, and the country was freed from the trouble."
joy,"He rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it."
joy,"He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented."
joy,"He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came to the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where the merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not withstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and his country in the same manner."
joy,"But he was thankful to the fox, and did not attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, ""Sit upon my tail, and you will travel faster."""
joy,"""Well,"" thought the young man, ""it is no hard matter to keep that advice."""
joy,"Then he went to the king, and told him all his brothers"" roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the princess given to him again; and after the king""s death he was heir to his kingdom."
joy,"The princess sprang up, threw her arms round his neck, embraced and kissed him repeatedly, and took her stomacher, which was made of pure gold, and hung it round his neck."
joy,"He found the blue light, and made her a signal to draw him up again."
joy,"When he was above, he said to the little man: ""Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before the judge."""
joy,"""Go wheresoever they take you, and let them do what they will, only take the blue light with you."""
joy,"And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever was heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other."
joy,"The servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him the best place in the court that he could wish for."
joy,"They leapt with delight, put out their heads, and cried to him: ""We will remember you and repay you for saving us!"""
joy,"The mother, however, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own daughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made to do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the family."
joy,Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a heap and walked on again.
joy,"The old woman spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter into her service."
joy,"She related to them all that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her great riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go and try her fortune."
joy,"At last she came to Mother Holle""s house, and as she had heard all about the large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged herself without delay to the old woman."
joy,"Still, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to be a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about."
joy,"Tom, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would not dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called out, ""My good friend, I can show you a famous treat."""
joy,"Tom heard all this, and cried out, ""Father, father!"
joy,"""Well,"" said they, ""you are come back, and we will not sell you again for all the riches in the world."""
joy,"When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train before the king""s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people running on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite loudly, and as if she would never stop."
joy,"But Red-Cap went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm her again."
joy,"At the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the dwarf, and what she had said."
joy,"""""Merrily the feast I""ll make."
joy,"""Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?"" said the lady slyly."
joy,"Then Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought that now she should go to the ball."
joy,"And then Ashputtel took the dishes to her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball."
joy,"Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden slipper."
joy,"And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and said, ""This is the right bride."""
joy,"Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, ""Old Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat."
joy,"""I have had plenty of meat,"" answered he, ""but I should like to have a piece of bread to eat after it."""
joy,"""Thou, queen, art the fairest in all the land."""
joy,"But Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years old she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself."
joy,"And the prince said, ""Thou art quite safe with me."""
joy,"""Many thanks,"" replied the old woman."
joy,"When the old woman heard that, she became quite friendly, and carried her over the water, gave her a wand, and said to her, ""Go, my daughter, ever onwards by this road, and when you come to a great black dog, you must pass it silently and boldly, without either laughing or looking at it."
joy,"She rejoiced much to see them again, and carried them all over the water, and then she too went away, for now she was freed."
joy,"""No care and no sorrow, A fig for the morrow!"
joy,"His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it."
joy,"""Feel,"" said he, ""how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight weeks old."
joy,"Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it, it has lived so well!"""
joy,I have much the best of the bargain.
joy,"Hans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes sparkled for joy, and he said to himself, ""Surely I must have been born in a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself."
joy,"The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on together."
joy,"After this the robbers never dared to go back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters that they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at this very day."
joy,"The children, who saw from a distance that some one was approaching, thought that their dear father was coming to them, and full of joy, ran to meet him."
joy,"The Queen went home quite delighted, and thought she had got rid of her step-children, but the girl had not run out with her brothers, and the Queen knew nothing about her."
joy,"The brothers were not less delighted to see their little sister, but their joy was of short duration."
joy,"Then she took a walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home."
joy,"I have saved up my three years"" earnings and have it all safe in my pocket."""
joy,"Then the countryman rejoiced at his good luck, and said, ""I like many things better than money: first, I will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly, a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask."""

joy,"Thomas , if I could write with the beauty in her eyes , I was born to look in them and know myself ."
joy,"Deeper , softer , none of your twittering larks . I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupted her song ."
joy,"Constantly . Without doubt , and plays the lute . She has a natural ear ."
joy,I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing .
joy,You're my hero .
joy,That sounds like a good idea .
joy,Look at that pretty girl .
joy,That's a very nice pair of glasses .
joy,Thank you so much . You are so sweet .
joy,"Well , that dress certainly shows your good taste . It must have cost a lot ."
joy,"Yes , and it goes beautifully with your pants ."
joy,Congratulations on your success in the competition . That is quite something .
joy,I am flattered .
joy,I hear that you have been promoted . Congratulations on your promotion !
joy,You have done excellent work .
joy,That's an understatement . I'm on cloud nine . I couldn't be any happier .
joy,I think so . It's turning out to be a great day .
joy,I hear your daughter graduated from high school as the valedictorian .
joy,Your knowledge of English is really surprising .
joy,"It ’ s very nice of you to say so . I should say you are glamorous yourself , as a matter of fact ."
joy,It ’ s okay . I ’ m still waiting to hear from UCLA anyway .
joy,That ’ s a good way to think about it .
joy,Aren't they cool ? I like the settings .
joy,Thank you so much for coming tonight . Everybody really enjoyed your performance .
joy,How about the new bar across the road ?
joy,Thank you . Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet .
joy,I'm glad you guys all have such a good sense of humor . Ha-ha ...
joy,Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations .
joy,I think a mountain village is splendid !
joy,My first grandchild .
joy,I ’ m sure you ’ ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country .
joy,"Oh , thank you so much ."
joy,Thank you !
joy,"He's after your own heart , it is important ."
joy,Good idea . That might help .
joy,"You made a good choice , then ?"
joy,It's super .
joy,"Good , I ' Ve get a two-pin plug ."
joy,It includes a lot of useful words and phrases .
joy,"Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us.That is excellent exercise and fun , too ."
joy,"Well , maybe you are right . We'll be more amused in a tram or a double-decker than on the subway ."
joy,"Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company ."
joy,I just got a telegram from Margaret and Greg .
joy,Yes . They ’ re coming the beginning of August .
joy,Remember the garden party they gave when we were in England ?
joy,"Yes , we are very proud of her ."
joy,"No . I'd like a slide , I have a new projector ."
joy,Oh you ’ re so kind !
joy,"If ever you ’ re in Chicago , please do look me up ."
joy,"Well , yes , I ’ d like to , if it ’ s not too much trouble ."
joy,No trouble at all . I think maybe you will meet some of my friends here as well .
joy,"Yes , With pleasure ."
joy,This is a nice set of wheels . How much did the dealer charge you for this ?
joy,"A lot . I probably got to moonlight for the rest of my life , but so what , it ’ s worth it . Come on , get in . Let ’ s take a drive ."
joy,"Hey , that ’ s a very nice hairdo you ’ re wearing !"
joy,Oh you ’ re exaggerating . I ’ m never really good at making hairdo .
joy,Why not ! These orders are not urgent . We could do it first thing tomorrow morning
joy,All right . Let's call it quits and go home .
joy,"You made a good choice , then ?"
joy,I am glad you are happy .
joy,"No , thank you . I've had enough ."
joy,"Yes , I will have a cup of coffee ."
joy,"Ok , cool ."
joy,Bye .
joy,The singing group used to be very popular .
joy,It's OK .
joy,I'm serious .

joy,"I'm all set . Thank you for the dinner , Jack ."
joy,"Thanks , Denise . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean , there were a lot of qualified people out there ."
joy,The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ?
joy,When did you learn to dance ?
joy,Cool ! The sound is great . These earphones are awesome !
joy,You certainly need that . You always pump the volume up way too high .
joy,"Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal ."
joy,"I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow ."
joy,"You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator ."
joy,How about the soup ?
joy,What a pin-up she is !
joy,I'm not flattering you.You ' re full of energy every day .
joy,Were you ? your performance was excellent .
joy,I felt as if I had been in a different world .
joy,"Cafe au lait , cafe latte , cappuccino , cafe mocha ... I can't keep them all straight !"
joy,The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors .
joy,Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon .
joy,I'm so glad I bought this watch !
joy,It's my new pendant . Do you like it ?
joy,"Yes , in a monkey suit . It's adorable !"
joy,Make it three cups . Here comes Harry .
joy,this is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax .
joy,"cooking makes me feel relaxed . So , what are we cooking ?"
joy,it's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ?
joy,"you're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering ."
joy,what do you think about this store ? I heard it ’ s a posh store that ’ s only got branches in big cities .
joy,how about this red dress ? I think it would really suit you .
joy,I think this color isn ’ t quite right for me . Do they have the same dress in white ?
joy,"let me look . Let ’ s see ... they ’ Ve got one in blue , green , pink , black ... and white . Here you are ."
joy,You have your ducks in a row .
joy,"Hey , your Chinese is coming along !"
joy,Yeah . It ’ s a lot better than mine .
joy,"not bad , any other ideas ?"
joy,So cool ! Can I get a load of it ?
joy,I just heard your boy had taken the first place in the history test . He is super cool .
joy,"Thanks , but I have to admit I am really good at bluffing !"
joy,I'm crazy about it.It makes me very excited .
joy,"I hear that you are going to participate in the dinner party tonight.Seen from what you are dressing , you really look like a fox ."
joy,Thank you . I couldn ’ t have done it without the help of a strong team .
joy,It ’ s so cool !
joy,Let ’ s go for a joy ride .
joy,Don't mention it . That's what friends are for !
joy,This is just for you . Cheers ! Bottoms up .
joy,I find that every employee here respects that manager very much .

joy,alright . See you later !
joy,"yes , do you like it ?"
joy,"see , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !"
joy,no problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ?
joy,"Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know ."
joy,"Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee !"
joy,"well , I personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy ."
joy,"Oh , it's made of wool . I like the striped pattern ."
joy,that's a good idea . When did you buy it ? Is it a name brand ?
joy,"yes , but I bought it when it was on sale , 50 % off the original price . OK , what do you think ?"
joy,"When the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree ."
joy,Yeah ! When I got my nose job I was black and blue for a week !
joy,"yeah , I'll call her later to patch things up ."
joy,why not ? It sounds great .
joy,cheers .
joy,The early bird catches the worm .
joy,This cake is excellent . Where did you buy it ?
joy,"Yes , I'd appreciate it if you could drive me downtown ."
joy,Thank you . You save me .
joy,Don't worry . Everything will go well . I promise !

joy,I ’ m glad you like them . Happy birthday !
joy,Forget it . It ’ s my pleasure . You mean a lot to me .
joy,A piece of cake ?
joy,"Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time ."
joy,My wife gave birth to our first child today .
joy,It's fun .
joy,"Yes , it is . Are you here on business ?"
joy,I couldn ’ t agree more .
joy,"Jim , how was your weekend ?"
joy,Thanks for your hospitality .
joy,Goodbye . Hope to see you again next year .
joy,It's been nice talking to you .
joy,Good-bye . See you again sometime .
joy,"Tell me about it , will you ?"
joy,"Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight !"
joy,"Tell you what , I'll be calling Jim late this week anyway , so I'll mention it to him then ."
joy,"Hey , that sounds a good idea ."
joy,That's great . I'll pick you up at eight .
joy,"I'm doing great , thank you ."
joy,So we can get down to business .
joy,Me too .
joy,How about going to the cinema tonight ?
joy,How's business ?
joy,Couldn't be better .
joy,Me too .
joy,"Hey , Mark , long time no see ."
joy,Julie ! It's good to see you again . How have you been ?
joy,Great . I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand .
joy,"Me too , they're such a nice couple ."
joy,Tom did me many favors .
joy,"No problem , anytime ."
joy,"I agree , I think that that would be perfect !"
joy,"Fine ! Well , I'll get right on it now !"
joy,The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat .
joy,I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers .
joy,I think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year .
joy,That is a good suggestion .
joy,It's the most fun I've had in years .
joy,"Oh , I went on a holiday in the city of Chende ."
joy,"Yes , I think the reason is that there is a big lake , and many trees in the Resort ."
joy,Goodbye until then . I promise you that you'll do well after we meet .
joy,"Well , thank you very much ."
joy,I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place !
joy,I want a different hair style .
joy,Can you make my hair short ?
joy,How much longer is it going to be ?
joy,It's going to be $ 55 .
joy,There you go . How do you like it ?
joy,Thanks for doing such a good job .
joy,"Please help yourself to whatever you like , don't be shy ."
joy,"Bottom's up , and you're right . This meal is incredible . I wish I had known this restaurant before . Thanks for bringing me here . I know I'll be back agile soon ."
joy,"If you like , I'll take you to a new restaurant next time , I just heard about it from my friend , and he was just raving about it . It's such a great Sichuan cuisine . Would you like to try that ?"
joy,Yeah ? I guess so . I spent the weekend at beach .
joy,That ’ s great . Where did you stay ?
joy,I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand . I couldn ’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down .
joy,It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that .
joy,Absolutely ! Everything that ’ s thrilling turns me on .
joy,"Well , my particular interest is collecting stamps , especially the rare ones . What about you ?"
joy,You said you like classical music very much . Then who is your favorite opera star ?
joy,"Yeah , it's really a unique experience . It's a solo concert by Pavarotti . He put on the performance in the Forbidden City in Beijing ."
joy,"I like peach blossom , because I like spring ."
joy,You have a perfect taste !
joy,But there aren't any lotus now .
joy,Great idea ! Here we go !
joy,We're going dancing tonight .
joy,"Hello , Candy . My name is Jim White . Nice to meet you ."
joy,"OK . It's 15066688866 . Call me ! Bye-bye , then ."
joy,"Hello , Rachel . It's glad to see you here ."
joy,"Hi , Ross . Glad to see you , too ."
joy,At 6 o'clock .
joy,OK . I'll come . See you then .
joy,Yes . Would you like to come here later to have a coffee ? Bring all your family .
joy,OK . Do you want us to bring something ?
joy,Good idea .
joy,Why not ? That's a good idea to help them .
joy,"Good idea . There is a good nightclub nearby , isn't it ?"
joy,Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can dance it very well . Let's dance it now .
joy,Thank you for your compliment .
joy,"It's very nice , I like it very much ."
joy,"In fact , I took up dancing quite recently , too ."
joy,"Well , its theme is moving and profound , so from the academic aspect , this is its advantage to win the award ."
joy,How about samba ?
joy,Shall we sing with a karaoke ?
joy,"For us , karaoke is becoming a popular entertainment ."
joy,I appreciate that .
joy,"You mean , we can do many other things after the picnic , right ?"
joy,You can take a bird-eye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain .
joy,"I could not agree with you more . For us , there are so many unhappy things and I am so bored ; however , I got lots of fun from stealing ."
joy,"No , I am not . And I love to meet new people in the chat rooms who share a lot in common with me ."
joy,OK . Bye .
joy,Dear Anna . I really love you .
joy,No ! I have been expecting this moment for a long time . I mean my answer is ' yes ' .
joy,What is it ?
joy,"Oh , how wonderful !"
joy,Yes . The scenery is so breathtaking .
joy,There are thousands of hot springs and fountains . The park is known for them .
joy,Thanks a lot .
joy,I like it . It's a beautiful country .
joy,We had a fantastic time .
joy,I always am . You just didn't notice .
joy,So cool . Someone gave me this flier at the exit . What's it about ?
joy,Why not ? I'd love to do that .
joy,Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ?
joy,Listen ! Some people are singing outside . Is it the opera ?
joy,"Yes , let's do it ."
joy,Help yourself .
joy,That would be lovely . But now let's go and get a drink .
joy,Sounds good . See you there !
joy,Thanks for coming shopping with me .
joy,I've never given a speech in front of a thousand people before .
joy,How in the world ! Who came up with seats like that from your company ?
joy,Can't beat that ! Thank you accounting guy !
joy,Can I read it when you're finished ?
joy,Yes . I'm in the last chapter now and it is just gripping .
joy,"I have to go home now , Jenny . Thanks for inviting me to your party ."
joy,"Why , thank you . I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not . I can't believe all the words the salesgirl said ."
joy,"Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes ."
joy,"Well , I don't know about the profit part yet . But I am really having fun !"
joy,I love your bracelet . When did you get it ?
joy,I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring .
joy,Thank you so much .
joy,That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .
joy,This really has been a wonderful holiday for us . Shall we take a walk around the pond or into those woods for a while ?
joy,"Sure . We can walk around to that path that leads into the woods there . Hey , look ! There are some wild ducks over there in the reeds ."
joy,"I used to go hunting with my uncle , that's how ."
joy,That's really exciting . How many months are you pregnant ?
joy,I like the way that the gifts I get increasingly more lavish .
joy,You see that chick over there ?
joy,Don't mention it . Good luck . You're going to need it .
joy,Fun for you ! Do you get to do anything you want ?
joy,This is going to be a major production for you !
joy,Aright . Have fun on Saturday .
joy,Our bass section is really good . You're going to love singing with them .
joy,I heard them warming up earlier . You're right .
joy,Very beautiful and very interesting . But why do you hang them in the tree ?
joy,Very good idea . Sometimes such pictures can show the house's richness .
joy,That sucks . You wanna go grab a beer ?
joy,It sounds like this is going to be authentic Mexican food .
joy,"Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin ."
joy,Just do whatever you feel like doing .
joy,Can you spread the word and ask everyone to bring some kind of snack food ?
joy,That's what I was thinking .
joy,Do you feel like a king in your castle ?
joy,Forsythia . It's also called winter jasmine which is the symbol of the spring's arrival .
joy,It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow . I admire the bravery of plum blossoms .
joy,Happy new year !
joy,"Merry Christmas , Lily ."
joy,"It's very thoughtful of you . Wow , it is so beautiful . Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas ?"
joy,How about tomorrow afternoon ?
joy,See you then .
joy,Good afternoon !
joy,OK . Any time on Friday will be OK with me .
joy,That's settled then . I'll contact you later .
joy,"Oh , you're lucky , there are just two tickets left . Do you want to take them ?"
joy,"Wonderful , I'll take them ."
joy,Sounds interesting .
joy,Of course . Do you want to see it ?
joy,We can hold them until one day before the show .
joy,You are welcome . Goodbye .
joy,"Whenever I go to Vegas , I get really excited ."
joy,It was so perfect that it won a unanimous 10 .
joy,"Exactly . Instead , we should have some drinks tonight ."
joy,Would you like to have some more wine ?
joy,It's really good .
joy,"Good afternoon , Sam ."
joy,Would you prefer our cocktail — Shanghai cocktail ? It's a mixture of real Chinese ingredients .
joy,"No problem . In the meantime , don't try to worry so much . You'll get through this ."
joy,"Nice meeting you , too ."
joy,It's really nice of you . Thanks !
joy,A beautiful center !
joy,That's a great idea . Why don't you call him . I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else .
joy,Sounds good .
joy,Yes . Very wonderful .
joy,I like the kid . He's so lovely .
joy,Shall we have a game together some day ?
joy,You can learn Chinese checkers or military chess . Both of them are much easier .
joy,"Thank you , David . You're always so encouraging ."
joy,"Yes , look at the photos I took ."
joy,They are beautiful . You did a good job .
joy,Let's go to Starbucks and think of something to do then .
joy,Aright . Do you have any cigarettes ?
joy,Aright . See you there .
joy,"Well , Tom . It's good to meet you . I have to go now . I am teaching a class this evening , and I need to get to the college ."
joy,He prefers suits to jackets .
joy,"That's pretty good . By the way , what are you doing next Saturday ?"
joy,"I am having a party Saturday night at my house . If you have time , you should come ."
joy,Thank you very much . I really had a good time .
joy,When and where ?
joy,"Look , I need another drink . Do you want one ?"
joy,Absolutely .
joy,I'll be back in a sec .
joy,"Oh , let's come in and enjoy yourself ."
joy,"Yeah , oh my god ! It ’ s still there . We have our first date right on there ."
joy,That's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ?
joy,It deserves it . The film gave us a lot of inspiration .
joy,"That's for sure . You know , I had the greatest time ever ."
joy,Don't tell me you have a record player !
joy,A silk scarf . I love it . Thank you very much . My lovely son .
joy,It's very exciting . I think .
joy,I will . Merry Christmas .
joy,I'd like to meet you again sometime .
joy,"That would be great . Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime ."
joy,Anytime . You can reach me at 5558929 .
joy,Fine .
joy,"It's time to go . Bye , Ella . Hope to see you soon"
joy,No problem . I'll talk to you later .
joy,It's interesting and I want to buy one home .
joy,"Oh , they are playing the wedding March . Here they come ."
joy,She is a beautiful bride .
joy,I am so happy for them .
joy,Harris and Anne are perfect for each other .
joy,Try to catch this bouquet then .
joy,Great . We'll go and have a try . Thank you very much .
joy,Would you like to have dinner with me at King Hotel at 7pm ?
joy,How do you like your new boss ?
joy,Good . Tonight 8 o'clock .
joy,Bye .
joy,"That's Cathy . She is pretty , isn't she ? She likes dancing . Ask her to dance ."
joy,Don't be afraid . She isn't going to bite you .
joy,"Donna , you really shocked everyone at the party last night !"
joy,Let's stop the car and enjoy it for a minute .
joy,Mother Nature is quite an artist .
joy,Look behind us at the mountains ! They're reflecting pink !
joy,Amazing . The sun is almost gone and yet there is still color everywhere !
joy,Are you enjoying married life ?
joy,Sound like everything is great .
joy,"Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures ."
joy,Now we have a two-year-old boy . We're very happy that he's healthy and smart .
joy,What does he look like ? Can people tell ?
joy,"Not bad , thanks ."
joy,"Hello , Rebecca , fancy meeting you here !"
joy,"Hi , Paul . I haven't seen you for a long time ."
joy,How have you been ?
joy,That ’ s great ! I ’ ll go there right now and speak with the boss .
joy,"That was nice of you , Susan . Thanks a lot ."
joy,"The fans are great here , too . Not like in Philadelphia ."
joy,"That's easy , how about a cowgirl ? Oh I know even better , a Canadian Mountie ."
joy,Oh good .
joy,Now that's a great plan . It's a date !
joy,I've no idea . I'd like to listen to your suggestion .
joy,"It's my pleasure . Actually , it's really hard to say as individual tastes are different . As for myself , I'd like to recommend gin and tonic ."
joy,"Well , I'll try gin and tonic ."
joy,The bourbon is 15 dollars plus 10 % service charge . So the total is 16.5 dollars .
joy,No way ! That sounds great !
joy,How about the new bar across road ?
joy,That sounds great . Where are you going ?
joy,Can you take part in our picnic this Saturday ?
joy,And don't forget your fishing tackle .
joy,"Haha , that's definitely a cheesy movie too . Did you watch it over and over again ?"
joy,Did you watch the final last night ? My favorite singer won !
joy,"He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him ."
joy,"No , you need to turn left into Philimore Was and take the next right ."
joy,I see . Talking with other people is very important .
joy,Oh thanks for inviting me . I'd love to come .
joy,Cedar is a good choice .
joy,"Not everyone . But a lot of people do , especially the young . It's a fine place to spend an evening with friends or to make some new friends ."
joy,"Oh yes , I know which one you mean . I have never been there , but I looked at their menu once and it did look good ."
joy,That's good . See you on Friday .
joy,"Oh , this one looks really good . And look at the garden . So beautiful ."
joy,Where should we meet ?
joy,"Oh , there are so many good ones ! I loved the Spice Girls . They were so cool !"
joy,"I was really sad too , but at least I can still listen to their Cds ."
joy,"Oh , that's funny !"
joy,"Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ?"
joy,"That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings ."
joy,That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ?
joy,Tell me about it .
joy,"Yeah , it was scary , but exhilarating ."
joy,"Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike ."
joy,That's what I do .
joy,"And maybe you suddenly have new interests . I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid . For instance , you used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging ."
joy,"Thanks , but I know falling in love is one thing while staying in love is another ."
joy,"Yeah , falling in love is so good ."
joy,Great . I'll stop by your place now .
joy,What time shall I pick you up ?
joy,Ok . I'll give it a try .
joy,"Yes . The drinks are very good ! I'm Paul , by the way ."
joy,That sounds so interesting . I wish I learned a hobby .
joy,I think I will . Thanks for the info .
joy,"Yeah , I ’ ll probably just stay in and relax . Maybe watch a few movies ."
joy,Can I stop by ?
joy,"Well , I was walking down Nan Jing Dong Lu ( Nan-Jing E . Rd . ) during my lunch break thinking about this boy-I have no idea why I was thinking about him ."
joy,Ok . I ’ ll take it .
joy,"Thanks . Gee , it's really light !"
joy,"Wow , that's really old ."
joy,OK .
joy,Pretty good .
joy,Don't worry . I'm sure you'll do better next time .
joy,Can you tell me how to improve myself ?
joy,It's a pleasure . Come on . I'm on your side .
joy,"How old are you , Su ?"
joy,How can we do that ?
joy,"Wow , this car can really burn rubber ."
joy,It's a great feeling .
joy,Perfect . Couldn't be better .
joy,You will be very beautiful on your wedding day .
joy,The Palace Hotel .
joy,"Happy birthday , George . Many happy returns of the day . Here's a present for you ."
joy,"I spend most of my spare time reading . And I subscribe to various newspapers , magazines and periodicals ."
joy,"In my spare time , I am fond of traveling and I always take a trip with my family ."
joy,Yeah.It is the very latest in digital video cameras .
joy,Getting cheaper is not the only reason for their popularity.They come with a lot of inviting functions .
joy,"They offer clearer and sharper images . Many of them also have up to 20x optical zoom lenses , a photo mode and fast-action mode ."
joy,Why haven't I thought of this skill ?
joy,It's nice . But what kind of dress are you looking for ?
joy,"We're going to a night club for dinner and dancing , then we'll go down to the city square for the big celebration . There's always a fireworks display put on by the local government . We all want you to come too ."
joy,"In that case , I'll be seeing you ."
joy,"Well , I think I like it . I appreciate the snow very much ."
joy,"Merry Christmas , Mr . Wang . I would like to give you the book I specially chose as my appreciation for your sincere help to me in the past few days ."
joy,"So , I understand why people eat moon cakes on that day ."
joy,"That's Okay , I think ."
joy,All right .
joy,"Of course , I like it very much . Thank you ."
joy,We are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center .
joy,How can I forget my old friend ?
joy,Thank you very much .
joy,That's fine . But you have to pay another $ 10 .
joy,"Wow , you're really informative . Thanks a lot ."
joy,I hear you are moving to Dalian .
joy,OK . I will write to you as soon as I get there .
joy,I just got a letter from an old high school buddy .
joy,Ha ! She is too little .
joy,I want to tell you that I like you
joy,Wow ! Blablablabla . . .
joy,LL
joy,It's my heart ; it's made of what you like .
joy,"Oh , I will have a sweet dream ."
joy,Are you sleepy ?
joy,"Wow , what a great burd !"
joy,"Hoo , I'm getting tired , Jeanine , been a long day ."

joy,"Thank you , Steven . I accept your advice ."

joy,"Thank you very much , David . It's an excellent birthday gift ."
joy,I'm going to the store downtown this afternoon to try on my wedding dresses .
joy,I think it's high time we had lunch .
joy,I suppose the local one .
joy,"That's a good idea . Let's see if we can get more people in this plan . There isn't much business these days anyway , so I think many people will be interested ."
joy,All right . What should I take ?
joy,See you Borrow .
joy,"Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman ."
joy,A boss likes him a lot . He says Jim is a good team player .
joy,Everybody would like to have Jim on their team . Because he is funny and helpful and he can contribute a lot to the team he belongs to .
joy,"Oh , what a beautiful garden !"
joy,The garden looks lovely when the roses are in bloom . You must have a lot of pleasure in planting flowers .

joy,Thank you . My wife would be very happy to hear this .
joy,"Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look ."
joy,"I am very happy , too . It was a big game and I won ."

joy,Fantastic .
joy,"Happy to know you , Tim ."
joy,Sure . Have you checked the weather report ?
joy,Yes . It says it will be sunny all day . No sign of rain at all .

joy,"Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food ."
joy,"If have time , I'll come again ."
joy,You're welcome at any time .
joy,"I do feel like a trip to Florida on such a gloomy day in New York , to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of Florida ."
joy,We are fishing with worms . The fish seem to like them .
joy,Looks like a lucky day for everyone .
joy,Mm . What came after that ?
joy,"Since the early 1960 ' s , there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening , unnatural situations , and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened , and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds . Some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have ."
joy,"Of course , no list of film would be complete without animated movies . These are especially popular among children ."
joy,He must be all over you the first time he saw you .
joy,How did you first meet Jack each other ?
joy,It's a romantic meeting . I can say that a hero saves a beauty .
joy,He is so humorous .
joy,"Don't be so shy , Lucy ."
joy,"She was pretty , her hair was the color of rich dark chocolate , waving gently to her shoulders . Her complexion was clear and golden ."
joy,Tomorrow is Sunday . Let's go out and get some fresh air .
joy,sounds very interesting . I can't wait to go there .
joy,"It is . However , you will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider ."
joy,Great ! Thank you very much .
joy,"Well , if you need some money to tide you over until payday , I can loan you some ."
joy,What do you usually do with them ?
joy,I very much like to go to a cafe and doze in the afternoon sunshine .
joy,Sounds great .
joy,I may take you there some day .
joy,Would you like to stretch your legs ?
joy,The seats are excellent . We're right in the center .
joy,It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great .
joy,"That's great . Well , we'd better get back to our seats . It's about to start ."
joy,See you then .
joy,Did you see the 2005 Grammy Awards on TV last night .
joy,He is really great . He has sold millions of records worldwide . He is especially known for his rocking performance at the football World Cup song-the Cup of World .
joy,"I see . We have already received many bookings and though I can't guarantee anything , please be assured that we'll try our best , Mr . Davis . I hope you'll understand ."
joy,"Yeah , that's the one I've heard the special effects and the plot are outstanding ."
joy,"Okay , see you then ."
joy,"I like the old styles of dance . Such as fox-trot , waltz , rumba , tango and so on . They're all graceful ."
joy,"I'm glad you like it.The band is called "" Four and One "" . They are especially good at playing rock and roll ."
joy,Now the band is playing a slow dance .
joy,That's a waltz . Would you like to try it ?
joy,What does it say ?
joy,How do you like this waltz ?
joy,"My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer , and I suppose you dance often ."
joy,"Yes , I can see . The summer heat is over , and the winter cold is still far away ."
joy,It seems that you are an optimistic man who doesn't dismay easily . That is what a good salesman needs . Good luck .
joy,Thank you .
joy,I guess we have covered all the stuff that we need to discuss and it's time to say goodbye .
joy,"Yes , goodbye and keep in touch ."
joy,I'm doing business through Internet now .
joy,"Yes , very good ."
joy,It is very convenient . You know you can browse the website and send e-mails to your customers at any time .
joy,Can I get the black ball in ?
joy,Let's get all the balls out of the pockets .
joy,( At the Party ) It's Christmas Eve ! Time to open presents !
joy,Here ! Open mine first .
joy,Wow ! It's just what I wanted !
joy,Sure did . It's a beauty . Where do you want it ?
joy,Let's put it over there .
joy,"Hand me some globes and paper flowers , I'll put them on these top branches ."
joy,Sure . I ’ Ve never seen a dragon boat race .
joy,I'd love a gin and tonic .
joy,What would you like to drink ?
joy,Thank goodness we're not rich and famous !
joy,"Being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich ."
joy,Guess what ! I know something you don't know !
joy,"I'm dead serious . They've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore ."
joy,"Yes , they can . If you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat ."
joy,I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way .
joy,"Point taken . Hopefully one day , we'll live in an interplanetary society ."
joy,How about going to a concert ?
joy,"That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red ."
joy,"Yeah , I want the note ."
joy,"Sure , I'd love to meet the cast ! Have you ever been in a play ?"
joy,The same to you !
joy,"It was nice to see you , too . And please give my regards to Mrs.Robbins ."
joy,"Yes . Swimming is one of my most favorite sports , indoors or out-doors ."
joy,"Yes , I did . I have never tasted anything like this ."
joy,"Ha , ha ! Those days are long gone ."
joy,That sounds good .
joy,How about ‘ Run of the Mill ? ’
joy,Great idea !
joy,You look so young .
joy,Okay .
joy,OK .
joy,"Position yourself , swinging the club , watch the ball and hit it as hard as you can ."
joy,Wonderful !
joy,You must have enjoyed yourself .
joy,"Yes , and I look many pictures ."
joy,"Ok , good luck to you ."
joy,But I am told that you dance wonderfully well .
joy,"Thanks for flattering me . I think you dance a lot , right ?"
joy,OK . Do you think we can go buy a newspaper first ?
joy,"I went there last year . If you want , I can give you some information I have about the city ."
joy,That'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ?
joy,Do you like surfing ?
joy,We've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun !
joy,"Sure , they do ."
joy,"Sounds good , when ?"
joy,Some time next year . We haven't set the date yet .
joy,Thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?
joy,"If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time ."
joy,Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?
joy,That's fine .
joy,Would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ?
joy,"We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ?"
joy,Hello ! So you are leaving today .
joy,Very well . If I leave I'll miss you .
joy,"Don ’ t worry , I will teach you how to win ."
joy,See you !
joy,Not at all . We've really enjoyed having you . I hope you'll come and stay again next time you're in Changsha .
joy,What time should I arrive ?
joy,"I know life is not all roses , and I believe I will pull this through ."
joy,"Not really , but I liked the design , so I got it ."
joy,Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better .
joy,Yes.Do you like it ?
joy,Peak periods always entail hours of queuing . At least you got a nice tan though !
joy,My friends and I just got back from Bali .
joy,I'll pick you up around 8: 00 .
joy,That's fine . I'm looking forward to it .
joy,"No , I've never heard of this song before . It's beautiful ! Who sing it ?"
joy,No . How about going to karaoke tonight ?
joy,"Oh , come on ! Just a quick one !"
joy,"Yes , of course . Thank you very much ."
joy,I'd love to .
joy,Yeah . It is incredible ! Is it the work of Qi Bakshi ?
joy,OK .
joy,Do you feel like going to see Paul and Claire tonight ?
joy,Are you going to the movie theater with me tonight ?
joy,No problem .
joy,"OK , how about 12:30 PM ?"
joy,How about Bill's Seafood Restaurant ?
joy,How about taking a walk in the park ?
joy,Thanks . I'll tell him .
joy,How about the Korean restaurant next to it ?
joy,"OK , I like that place ."
joy,Small please .
joy,He's really good looking .
joy,Yeah ! But you know sometimes the weather forecast is not correct . Maybe tomorrow is a clear day . Who knows ?
joy,I know your feeling . Take it easy and say something to me if you like .
joy,If you wait a minute I can go with you .
joy,OK . I'll wait for you .
joy,"Sure , I've been meaning to visit that place myself ."
joy,Then I'II make reservations for 9 pm for a party of four .
joy,Okay . See you then .
joy,Just find the answer through Internet .
joy,I understand .
joy,You are right . Let ’ s stop idling around and do something .
joy,I see . And I'll always be devoted to you .
joy,I'll never hurt you ; I'll never lie .
joy,How many can we choose ?
joy,"Well , whatever it does , I feel transformed !"
joy,I requested it . What do you say ? Do you have your dancing shoes on ?
joy,"Fine , what do you call this ?"
joy,Let me see . We can visit the country . We haven't done that for such a long time .
joy,"It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say ."
joy,I quite agree with you.See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry !
joy,You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon .
joy,"Oh , my shoes pinch me . Let's find a seat and sit a while ."
joy,OK . I have a good pair of hiking boots . It should not be a big problem .
joy,"All kinds , but mostly Pop , rock and classical . Why ?"
joy,"Yes , that's a good idea ."
joy,"Oh , I think I know the place you mean . We ate there last month , right ?"
joy,When can we expect you for dinner ? Can you come tonight ?
joy,Well ... How about Friday then ?
joy,That sounds fine .
joy,"I'll be there . You're still a fabulous cook , aren't you ?"
joy,"Well , he's very tall and handsome ."
joy,I guess I asked the wrong person .
joy,Yes .
joy,That would be great .
joy,I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ?
joy,OK . My wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now . I am leaving .
joy,Bye .
joy,You are invited to my wedding .
joy,"Oh , that's fantastic !"
joy,"Oh , hi , Lee . You look great ."
joy,Thanks . You too .
joy,"so nice to see you again , Louise . How are you doing ?"
joy,Not too bad .
joy,Hi ! My name is Mike .
joy,"Yes , thank you . I ’ Ve already been helping myself ."
joy,"I like hot food , especially Sichuan cuisine ."
joy,"Come on , it's the weekend . Let's taste and enjoy this meal . Cheers !"
joy,He asked me out to a dinner tonight . How about joining us ?
joy,Do you like olives ? Or would you prefer crisps ?
joy,"Yes . Hey , I've got some photos of our holiday in Ireland . Would you like to see them ?"
joy,"Oh , Amy . I am the luckiest guy in the world ."
joy,Oh . Graham . I love you so much and I really believe in our love .
joy,I've been really busy . How is everything ?
joy,"Yeah , why not ? I've got a little free time on my hands . Where do you want to eat ?"
joy,"Yes , I think I am . Let's meet for lunch at mouth restaurant ."
joy,That's fine . See you there !
joy,"Fortunately , there is no person died ."
joy,That's great . It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake .
joy,"Yeah , we've experienced the 8.0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchman ."
joy,"Right . But people at that time only know two words , "" save "" and "" assistance "" , they will never don't lift a finger . Life is the most important compared with anything else ."
joy,What a pin-up she is !
joy,That's interesting . How often do you write a blog ?
joy,"Pretty good , thanks . I'm going to see my uncle ."
joy,"It was great . The director took a lot of care while framing . They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director . Also I like the actors , some really great new young actors ."
joy,It would be a really good choice . The movie is very suitable for lovers to see together . I'm sure you won't regret it .
joy,I'd love something spicy . Maybe we could get some Sichuan hotpot .
joy,"Nice to meet you , too ."
joy,She looks very healthy.How old is she ?
joy,He must be very brave .
joy,Exactly !
joy,"Sure , he's ready to be friendly with anyone ."
joy,You're right . Mother's love is the greatest love in the world .
joy,"I get it . You want to find a guide , don ’ t you ?"
joy,"Yes , Steven . You always know what I want ."
joy,Thank you !
joy,How about seven ?
joy,Sure . You've given a great help to me in the past days .
joy,Certainly . I'll be glad to .
joy,That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ?
joy,"I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy ."
joy,"The Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food ."
joy,Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
joy,"No , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time ."
joy,I won't argue with that ! Let's go !
joy,"Yeah , I'm going to the Temple Fair with my family ."
joy,There is a beautiful state park here . I can see why so many people come out here to camp .
joy,I will sometime . Thanks for the advice .
joy,Was it love at first sight ?
joy,"Let ’ s just say that by the third date , we both realized that we had fallen in love ."
joy,We waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa .
joy,Thank you for your caring . I will .
joy,Thank you for saying that . It's a present from my girlfriend .
joy,"Good morning , Kevin ."
joy,How about having dinner with me ?
joy,"All right , see you tonight ."
joy,"Anyway , I owe you one . Are you free tonight ?"
joy,Yes . Why ?
joy,"Oh , congratulations !"
joy,Thank you !
joy,Thank you . I will if I have chance.Goodbye and happy landing !
joy,That ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work .
joy,I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing !
joy,Of course not . You can come to London to visit me in future . And I also will come here if I have a chance .
joy,I will miss you .
joy,Let's see . Have you been to a jazz club yet ?
joy,"Uh , actually , I've gone twice this week ."
joy,"Oh , OK . I hear there's a terrific show at the Sanger Theater ."
joy,Great ! Let's make a reservation .
joy,"Yes , the chicken looks wonderful !"
joy,"Sure , I love salad !"
joy,Don ’ t worry . I'll buy a new necklace as same as the old one .
joy,"It is so kind of you , Dad ."
joy,Would you like to go to a concert tonight ?
joy,I'd like to very much .
joy,There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ?
joy,Yes . I got very excited .
joy,My friend Jean is very beautiful .
joy,Sounds like you're happy with your decision .
joy,I've been great . What about you ?
joy,She knows how to speak Spanish and Japanese .
joy,Wow ! ! !
joy,"Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already ."
joy,"That sounds like fun , but did you exercise ?"
joy,"Oh , that's OK . Let's just meet at the theater before the show , around 7:30 ."
joy,"Say , Anna , what are you doing tonight ? Would you like to go out ?"
joy,Sounds great !
joy,"Say , why don't you come with us ? We have plenty of room ."
joy,Brian ! How have you been ?
joy,"Oh , well , I've lost some weight . And my hair is longer than before ."
joy,"Hi , Celia ! How was your trip to the United States ?"
joy,"Mary , can I get Josh or you something to drink ?"
joy,"I like the pier too , because it's beautiful at night ."
joy,So you want to go to Malibu ?
joy,I'm doing really well .
joy,"OK , please ."
joy,"Yes . The ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth , and they have developed into a festival filled with food , performances and games now ."
joy,Of course .
joy,Couldn't be better .
joy,I enjoy camping .
joy,You must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun .
joy,"Yeah , I will be there ."
joy,Wonderful . Just e-mail me the time and date and I'll be there .
joy,That sounds like a great idea !
joy,I thought that we could leave around 8
joy,"Oh yes , everyone we are inviting is from our company ."
joy,Great ! I'll look forward to it . We'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation .
joy,Just bring along whatever it is that you and Jake would like to drink .
joy,Good ! I am really thirsty . You know it really is hot outside !
joy,Fine .
joy,"Yes , the weather sure is nice today ."
joy,"That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot ."
joy,"I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado ; but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day ."
joy,Good afternoon !
joy,"Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ?"
joy,"Good morning , Mei ! How are you ?"
joy,"I like spring , too.We can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air ."
joy,"Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?"
joy,"You forgot all of about it , didn't you ?"
joy,"Sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour ."
joy,"Alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ?"
joy,Eighteen.Some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight.Do you want to come ?
joy,Very much.What time ?
joy,Ok that sounds good . Where shall I meet you ?
joy,"Yes , it looks interesting ."
joy,You're right . I love it very much .
joy,Isn't it wonderful walking here ?
joy,Did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower .
joy,"Yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of travelling in the city , I felt sick I think I had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening ."
joy,Yes . you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad.sometimes new food might disagree with you .
joy,Yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry .
joy,"Oh , ISEE . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors ."
joy,He sure is !
joy,"Yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice ."
joy,"You bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight ."
joy,Sounds a good weekend . You know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and Jo can become such close friends .
joy,"Yeah , I never thought we could be good friends either . We have our differences . She's more outgoing and active while I am more quiet and reversed , but we still get along extremely well . We can talk for hours about anything ."
joy,Exactly . Having Jo as my friend is one of the best things that's ever happened to me .
joy,"Yeah , you are so lucky to have found each other ."
joy,"Oh , thanks a lot ."
joy,That's the plan .
joy,You are right . They sweep Nancy off her feet . And now she fell head over heels in love with him .
joy,"Oh , that would be very useful ."
joy,Mmm ... Well we could go to that new art gallery instead .
joy,Yes that might be a better idea .
joy,Maybe we ’ ll meet some of the artists too .
joy,Ok - let ’ s do that then !
joy,And the people were so friendly !
joy,I ate so much that I wasn't hungry until afternoon the next day .
joy,Thanks . Some tea would be nice . Chinese tea is great . I really like your tea set . Where did you get it ?
joy,"Well , if you want we can go together sometime . Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon , if you like , you can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way ."
joy,That would be wonderful . Thanks !
joy,Bye .
joy,Matthew ? Hi !
joy,"Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look ."
joy,How about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym .
joy,"Me , too . What did you have in mind ?"
joy,Oh . It was great . I love Ma Lin . He ’ s my favourite table tennis player . Have you seen anything yet ?
joy,"Well , let ’ s go to the marathon tomorrow then ! We can just stand by the side of the road ."
joy,Yes I am . I got married five years ago .
joy,Oh really ! That sounds lovely .
joy,Why don ’ t we go the cinema tonight ?
joy,"If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book ."
joy,I agree with you .
joy,"Yes , actually it ’ s my second visit . I was there last October ."
joy,I see . What ’ s it like there ?
joy,I like football best of all .
joy,Almost two years ? Your English is very good .
joy,Thank you . But there's still a lot for me to learn .
joy,"En , it's so beautiful that I don't want to move my eyes from it ."
joy,"The same to me . All the things here make me happy , the mountain , the water , the grass , the birds , the sunshine ..."
joy,I think we should go out more frequently . The natural scenery can do us good .
joy,Do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city ?
joy,"Hi Amy , you look very happy ."
joy,You look great . Your make-up is perfect .
joy,"No , the one you have on looks fabulous , especially with your hair like that ."
joy,"Thanks for helping out . Now that I ’ m ready , what are you doing tonight ?"
joy,Sounds fun . Anyone I know ?
joy,Sounds great ! How many kinds of folk collections do they have ?
joy,"Private collectors ! They must have excellent collections . I'II go and see each of them . What kinds of collections can I see ? Come on , don't keep me in suspense !"
joy,Next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine .
joy,Why not ? It sounds great .
joy,Thanks . Cheers .
joy,Cheers .
joy,I am happy . I just bought a new car .
joy,"Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway ."
joy,"Jenny , I want to go on a picnic . Could you come too ?"
joy,"Me too , but I think we shouldn't drink too much of it , as it's not very healthy ."
joy,"Just think , in a few days , I'll be swimming and lying in the sun and just taking it easy ."
joy,You'll see the world-famous magnificent waterfall .
joy,I like the sight and the sound . It worked on me like a magic when I was a child
joy,"Yes , I enjoyed it very much ."
joy,"Let me see . Ah , yes , I've been to England , France , Germany , Italy and now I've been in Spain"
joy,That's right
joy,We're lucky today .
joy,Sure . I can see you're enjoying your trip today .
joy,"Jenny , I want to go on a picnic . Could you come too ?"
joy,I'd be glad to . I love picnicking .
joy,"Sure . Bring enough films , please ."
joy,I sure will .
joy,It's certainly a popular hobby . I know a lot of people love stamps .
joy,"Well , every stamp has a story to tell ."
joy,How's it going ?
joy,All right . See you then .
joy,"Yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day ."
joy,"Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ..."
joy,Is everything ready now ?
joy,"Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive ."
joy,Thanks . I could eat a cow .
joy,Yeah . I have got much pressure in the company . I have tobe wrapped upon my work .
joy,Thank you . I will .
joy,Thank you .
joy,You are so thoughtful .
joy,"Come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry ."
joy,"Yes , I came to Beijing two years ago looking for new opportunities . I was lucky because my friend introduced me to my current company ."
joy,Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ...
joy,Don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself .
joy,You dance beautifully too .
joy,"Oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ?"
joy,"Ok , thank you ."
joy,Congratulations to you .
joy,Thank you .
joy,I ’ ll call you later . Bye .
joy,So he will make a perfect husband . Make sure you will be here next Monday .
joy,I promise !
joy,"I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby !"
joy,"And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does ."

joy,A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ’ d also like to have a mudpack on my face . It ’ s supposed to help with your complexion .

joy,"She likes to complain about her macho husband and her “ bambinos ” , but she loves them all dearly ."
joy,"You have no idea ! There's a banquet with prizes , performances ... you name it !"
joy,We're waiting in line to get one of Master Li's Chinese couplets . I got one last year and I had good luck all year !

sadness,"The lilac bends its fresh fragrant flowers over the dead man's head; the swallow passes again- ""twit, twit;"" now the men come with hammer and nails, the lid is placed over the dead man, while his head rests on the dumb book- so long cherished, now closed for ever!"
sadness,"I became so tired, so heavy, that the beam broke, and I flew out into the gleaming Au, where the water is deepest, and where the Au-mann lives, solitary and alone; and year by year I tell him what I have heard and what I know."
sadness,"But the schoolmaster says that there was not any bell that rung down there, for that it could not do so; and that no Au-mann dwelt yonder, for there was no Au-mann at all!"

sadness,"Away, away, that is the end of it all."""
sadness,"Well, perhaps, if in the beginning of a book these were written and printed, many, when they read it, would lay the book down and say, ""It seems to me a very miserable title, I don't like things of this sort."""
sadness,"Here, behind the white iron railings, once a rose-tree grew; it is gone now, but a little bit of evergreen, from a neighboring grave, stretches out its green tendrils, and makes some appearance; there rests a very unhappy man, and yet while he lived he might be said to occupy a very good position."

sadness,"""Oh, he was such a kind, good-hearted man, there are not many like him,"" and the tears rolled down her cheeks as she spoke."
sadness,"O kind Heaven, help me to get home; I am in a burning fever."
sadness,"And he, poor boy, wept also, as he sat alone by the river, near to and watching the damp linen."
sadness,"Indeed the poor bird had good reason to be sad, for it had been caught and put into a cage close by the open window."
sadness,"Alas! you only remind me of what I have lost."""
sadness,"""WHENEVER a good child dies, an angel of God comes down from heaven, takes the dead child in his arms, spreads out his great white wings, and flies with him over all the places which the child had loved during his life."
sadness,"""Down in that narrow lane, in a low cellar, lived a poor sick boy; he had been afflicted from his childhood, and even in his best days he could just manage to walk up and down the room on crutches once or twice, but no more."
sadness,"In this spot the poor sick boy would sit warming himself in the sunshine, and watching the red blood through his delicate fingers as he held them before his face."
sadness,I am so fine that even my mother cannot find me.
sadness,"Had I still my old eye, which was broken off, I believe I should weep; but no, I would not do that, it is not genteel to cry."""
sadness,"Oh, I cannot bear it."""
sadness,"""I cannot bear it any longer,"" said the tin soldier; ""I have wept tears of tin, it is so melancholy here."
sadness,"Ah, really he must be very happy; I cannot endure this life."""
sadness,"I will go to the wars!"" cried the tin soldier as loud as he could, and threw himself down on the floor."
sadness,"Anne Lisbeth went forth from the castle into the public road, feeling mournful and sad; he whom she had nursed day and night, and even now carried about in her dreams, had been cold and strange, and had not a word or thought respecting her."
sadness,"""My poor flowers are quite dead,"" said little Ida, ""they were so pretty yesterday evening, and now all the leaves are hanging down quite withered."

sadness,"He and his sister, two years older than himself, had often wept scalding tears over the story of Him who suffered death on the cross for us all."
sadness,"A record of this bright display will live in the memory of man, for through it the pupil in the military school was in tears and sorrow."
sadness,"People will only see how large, how very large it is."
sadness,Alas!
sadness,"And that is the life drama that passes before the old maid while she looks out upon the rampart, the green, sunny rampart, where the children, with their red cheeks and bare shoeless feet, are rejoicing merrily, like the other free little birds."
sadness,"""You are right,"" said the emperor, and began to cry like a little child."
sadness,"""Alas, unfortunate creature that I am!"" said the princess, ""I wish I had accepted the prince."
sadness,If he would only come in here!
sadness,"Tears of sorrow rolled down their cheeks, and fell in heavy drops on the floor, but not a word was spoken."
sadness,"Thou knowest: ah, pity me!"
sadness,"Oh, how much happier I should be could I change my being and position with him, and pass through life with his humble expectations and hopes!"
sadness,"Yes, this is my fate,"" and he sighed deeply."
sadness,"In the cold and the darkness, a poor little girl, with bare head and naked feet, roamed through the streets."
sadness,"""Grandmother,"" cried the little one, ""O take me with you; I know you will go away when the match burns out; you will vanish like the warm stove, the roast goose, and the large, glorious Christmas-tree."""
sadness,"He was hungry and thirsty, yet no one gave him anything; and when it became dark, and they were about to close the gardens, the porter turned him out."
sadness,"Once more he clasped the neck of his metal horse, kissed its nose, and nodded farewell to it."
sadness,"Hunger and thirst overpowered the child, and he became quite faint and ill."
sadness,But there was nothing to be seen; whatever he had heard had passed already.
sadness,"The poor little thing trembled so with cold, that the boy ran homeward as fast as he could."
sadness,"Ib sat down to write, but he could not get on at all."
sadness,"At last a very little girl came out of one of the wretched-looking houses, and Ib asked her to tell him the way to the street he wanted; she looked up timidly at him, and began to cry bitterly."
sadness,"Her youngest child, looked for in the midst of prosperity, had sunk into the grave when only a few weeks old; and at last Christina herself became sick unto death, and lay, forsaken and dying, in a miserable room, amid poverty she might have borne in her younger days, but which was now more painful to her from the luxuries to which she had lately been accustomed."
sadness,"It makes me unhappy to think that I shall die, and leave this poor child,"" sighed she."
sadness,He never knew; for not another word escaped her lips.
sadness,"There had been a great deal of talk on this subject while the basket was being packed, and during this conversation the eyes and the mouth of the furrier's daughter did not wear a very joyful expression."
sadness,"""Then I shall be obliged to lie out here,"" said Little Claus to himself, as the farmer's wife shut the door in his face."
sadness,"""Oh, dear,"" sighed Little Claus from the top of the shed, as he saw all the good things disappear."
sadness,"She had been cross, unkind, and really spiteful to him; but he was very sorry, and took the dead woman and laid her in his warm bed to see if he could bring her to life again."
sadness,"If he dried his eyes with his nightcap, then the tear and the picture would be crushed; but the source of the tears remained and welled up again in his heart."
sadness,"How vividly were represented to him, in a glittering tear that rolled down his cheek, two children at play- a boy and a girl."
sadness,"One, two, three years went by, and during the whole time he received only two letters."
sadness,Not a tear came into his eye; he felt he was no longer Molly's friend.
sadness,How much came back to his remembrance as he looked through the tears once more on his native town!
sadness,"There lay the old bachelor, forsaken by all, and unable to help himself."
sadness,"""But we have no theatre,"" cried little Anna, ""and we have no one to act for us; my old doll cannot, for she is a fright, and my new one cannot, for she must not rumple her new clothes."""
sadness,"""'Though I'm all ear, Very stupid I appear: Where's my humor?"
sadness,"""Croak, croak, croak,"" was all her son could say for himself; so the toad took up the elegant little bed, and swam away with it, leaving Tiny all alone on the green leaf, where she sat and wept."
sadness,"""No, it must never be!"" so they assembled together in the water, round the green stalk which held the leaf on which the little maiden stood, and gnawed it away at the root with their teeth."
sadness,"Then he flew down with her from the tree, and placed her on a daisy, and she wept at the thought that she was so ugly that even the cockchafers would have nothing to say to her."
sadness,"Then she wrapped herself up in a dry leaf, but it cracked in the middle and could not keep her warm, and she shivered with cold."
sadness,"""You poor little creature,"" said the field-mouse, who was really a good old field-mouse, ""come into my warm room and dine with me."""
sadness,"""Farewell, you pretty little bird,"" said she, ""farewell; thank you for your delightful singing during the summer, when all the trees were green, and the warm sun shone upon us."
sadness,"But Tiny knew it would make the field-mouse very grieved if she left her in that manner, so she said, ""No, I cannot."""
sadness,"Every morning when the sun rose, and every evening when it went down, she would creep out at the door, and as the wind blew aside the ears of corn, so that she could see the blue sky, she thought how beautiful and bright it seemed out there, and wished so much to see her dear swallow again."
sadness,And as she told him she wept.
sadness,"Oh, if I could only get them safe on land!"
sadness,I escaped fortunately as far as the threshold of the door; but there I fell down and remained: I could go no farther.
sadness,"""But we must part,"" said the young man; ""your brother does not like our engagement, and therefore he sends me so far away on business, over mountains and seas."
sadness,"And then they kissed each other, and the girl wept, and gave him a rose; but before she did so, she pressed a kiss upon it so fervently that the flower opened."
sadness,"Nobody knows his grave; no holy words have been read over it!"""
sadness,"If his father had only lived to see it!"""
sadness,"FAR down in the forest, where the warm sun and the fresh air made a sweet resting-place, grew a pretty little fir-tree; and yet it was not happy, it wished so much to be tall like its companions- the pines and firs which grew around it."
sadness,"Still, as it grew, it complained, ""Oh! how I wish I were as tall as the other trees, then I would spread out my branches on every side, and my top would over-look the wide world."
sadness,Oh! when will Christmas be here?
sadness,"""Past! past!"" said the old tree; ""Oh, had I but enjoyed myself while I could have done so! but now it is too late."""
sadness,"But she has no one to mourn, neither father nor mother, neither relations nor sweetheart."
sadness,"""I advise you to do what you think will turn out to your happiness,"" said the girl."
sadness,"""Rich and prospering in every respect,"" he said; ""the woman is brave and good, but you are in my heart."
sadness,"A week has passed; this morning his death was in the newspaper, that is the reason of the girl's mourning!"
sadness,"The black bow signifies mourning, the girl's face points to the same in a still higher degree; it is preserved in the heart and will never be forgotten."
sadness,"Crows and rooks came by turns and sat on them, and talked of the hard times which were beginning, and how difficult it was in winter to obtain food."
sadness,"The grand, majestic oak could not be quite happy in the midst of his enjoyment, while all the rest, both great and small, were not with him."
sadness,Who can replace it?
sadness,"He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain."
sadness,"""Oh!"" she said, ""I have knocked off brother""s head,"" and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her."
sadness,"Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of her bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the table and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but weep."
sadness,"Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly offered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream; and this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and managed to get Partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners, who were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water and were all carried away by the stream and drowned."
sadness,"My golden ball has fallen into the spring."""
sadness,Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.
sadness,"""The old woman has destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at once, and took their lives."
sadness,"But one of the good qualities which old Mr Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the cat had continually to send the suitors away."
sadness,"The aged king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the king""s own heart, and he soon died."
sadness,"Then Thumbling began to cry, and for the sake of peace his father put him in his pocket, and took him with him."
sadness,"The fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the seashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and green."
sadness,So the man went away quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king.
sadness,"""Alas, wife! why should you wish to be emperor?"" said the fisherman."
sadness,"They therefore drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water."
sadness,"Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife: ""What is to become of us?"
sadness,"How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?"""
sadness,"Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel: ""Now all is over with us."""
sadness,"Nevertheless, she promised not to go away, but to continue keeping house for the shepherd."
sadness,"Night fell, and nothing was left for him to do, but to seek a bed in this painful solitude."
sadness,"After these words he was about to slip into his hut again, but the tailor held him so tightly by the corner of his coat, and pleaded so piteously, that the old man, who was not so ill-natured as he wished to appear, was at last softened, and took him into the hut with him where he gave him something to eat, and then pointed out to him a very good bed in a corner."
sadness,"He held with both hands to the tops of the horns, and resigned himself to his fate."
sadness,"""I dare not shoot at him,"" said the huntsman, ""for I should kill the beautiful young lady also."""
sadness,"As a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a wood, there came up a little old woman, and said to him, ""Good day, good day; you seem merry enough, but I am hungry and thirsty; do pray give me something to eat."""
sadness,"""Alas! dear sir,"" said she, ""yonder lies the granite rock where all the costly diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there, that whenever I think of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only the birds and the flies--man cannot."""
sadness,"When he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him alone on the wild rock, he said, ""Alas! what roguery there is in the world!"" and there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to do."
sadness,"Then he looked around him, and said, ""I wish I had something to eat, if not I shall be worse off than before; for here I see neither apples nor pears, nor any kind of fruits, nothing but vegetables."""
sadness,"I have been lucky enough to find it, and have brought it with me; but the heat of the sun scorches so that it begins to wither, and I don""t know that I can carry it farther."""
sadness,"The messenger sat all this time with the beautiful young lady, and as nobody came with the salad and she longed to taste it, she said, ""I don""t know where the salad can be."""
sadness,"I know even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable to save me."""
sadness,"She was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, ""I know he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free."""
sadness,"The man now thought he should like to continue his journey, but the giant begged him to remain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother, who was away in search of provisions."
sadness,"Then he fetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until at last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away."
sadness,"""It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been thine."""
sadness,Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly which had brought her so low.
sadness,"""I cannot and dare not tell you,"" said he."
sadness,"And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each other, and they moved backwards and forwards, he thought to himself: ""If you shiver below by the fire, how those up above must freeze and suffer!"""
sadness,"Ah, if I could but shudder!"""
sadness,"""I don""t know,"" answered the youth."
sadness,"""I know not."""
sadness,"Then said he: ""After all it is a pity,--for so handsome a man."""
sadness,"Then the dwarf said, ""My masters are not at home; but if you will wait till they come, pray step in."""
sadness,"Catherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired; but she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said softly, ""Frederick, I must let the nuts go."""
sadness,"The king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage."
sadness,"When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy down from his shoulder, and said to him: ""You will never see your father and mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free, and I have compassion on you."
sadness,"But as you have not a bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is one thing I will grant you; if you fall into any difficulty, come to the forest and cry: ""Iron Hans,"" and then I will come and help you."
sadness,"There he looked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing by which he could help himself."
sadness,"But her father began to be very sorrowful, and to weep, saying, ""Alas, my dearest child!"
sadness,"I have bought this flower at a high price, for I have said I would give you to a wild lion; and when he has you, he will tear you in pieces, and eat you."""
sadness,"Wilt thou then forget me quite?"""
sadness,"Our meals are the hard crusts of bread that are left over; and the little dog under the table is better off, for she often throws it a nice bit."
sadness,"They walked the whole day over meadows, fields, and stony places; and when it rained the little sister said, ""Heaven and our hearts are weeping together."""
sadness,"It certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right time!"""
sadness,"""If he had but left me one, so that something remained for me to eat."""
sadness,"If I did not take pity on you and save you, you would be lost."""
sadness,"""I bring nothing, I want something given me."""
sadness,"""Never mind, will do better next time."""
sadness,"""I bring nothing, but would have something given."""
sadness,"""I took nothing, but had something given me."""
sadness,"""Never mind, will do better next time."""
sadness,"""Oh, yes,"" said the girl in a sad voice, ""that you certainly can, but I do not advise you to venture it."
sadness,"The maiden sighed and said, ""My step-mother practises wicked arts; she is ill-disposed toward strangers."""
sadness,"""Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?"" said he to the merchant; ""what is it you take so deeply to heart?"""
sadness,"Then he said to his beloved: ""I must now go and leave you, I give you a ring as a remembrance of me."
sadness,"The youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he begged for a night""s lodging."
sadness,"The whole district was in sorrow and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to stop this."
sadness,"He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they were saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad."
sadness,"At last he arrived in Rome, where the Pope had just died, and there was great doubt among the cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his successor."
sadness,"He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes."
sadness,"Now this hill was so big that the whole world could not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had done very little, the fox came and said."
sadness,"Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not eat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept."
sadness,"Then he was much troubled, and made known to the whole land that whosoever brought his daughters back again should have one of them to wife."
sadness,"""Oh, very badly,"" said he, and then they lamented their misfortune together, but they said nothing about it to the youngest, for they did not like him at all, and always called him Stupid Hans, because he did not exactly belong to the forest."
sadness,"There was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer because of the many wounds which he had received."
sadness,"He sat for a while very sorrowfully, then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which was still half full."
sadness,"Then when the king in his grief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died."
sadness,"They were telling one another of all the places where they had been waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and one said in a pitiful tone: ""Something lies heavy on my stomach; as I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen""s window."""
sadness,"When his request was granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water."
sadness,"All the people grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him alone by the sea."
sadness,"So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began to grow unhappy."
sadness,"Our Lord then inquired if he had no wine, and he said, ""Alack, sir, the casks are all empty!"""
sadness,"There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called Dummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion."
sadness,"When he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day, and said: ""Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket, and let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty."""
sadness,"""I have nothing left,"" said she."
sadness,"""That may never be,"" thought the miller""s daughter: and as she knew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do what he asked."
sadness,"The wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew nigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, ""Always be a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you."""
sadness,"In the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how grieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the ground, as if she was quite dead."
sadness,"So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just as it did while she was alive; so they said, ""We will never bury her in the cold ground."""
sadness,"Now this king and queen had plenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of good things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but though they had been married many years they had no children, and this grieved them very much indeed."
sadness,"If I kill her, what will she be good for?"
sadness,"""I am making a little trough,"" answered the child, ""for father and mother to eat out of when I am big."""
sadness,"Then she sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the misfortune which lay before her."
sadness,"Then said the mother likewise: ""What a clever Elsie we have!"" and sat down and wept with them."
sadness,"When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting quite piteously, each outdoing the other."
sadness,"""Ah, dear Hans,"" said Elsie, ""if we marry each other and have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw something to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might dash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to weep?"""
sadness,"""Alas, dear father,"" she answered, ""they have gone away and left me alone!"" and she told him that she had seen from her little window how her brothers had flown away over the forest in the shape of swans, and she showed him the feathers, which they had let fall in the courtyard, and which she had picked up."
sadness,Oh ! Sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual as we have steak from the market every day .

sadness,"Don't worry . Anyway , you are better than me ."
sadness,I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another . Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ?
sadness,I'm thinking of dropping out .
sadness,I'm not being pessimistic . I'm being realistic . My chemistry is so bad .
sadness,I failed the exam because I didn't study .
sadness,B :: I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me .
sadness,You know ... I did very poorly on that test .
sadness,I have to find something.Otherwise I have to go back to Taiwan . I'll be broke in two months .
sadness,I keep on meeting with difficulties in the experiment . I can hardly go on .

sadness,"I'm so sorry , I .. I didn't realize it was that loud ."
sadness,"I'm sorry , I didn't mean to forget our wedding anniversary ."

sadness,"As a matter of fact , I am a bit upset . I just came out of a meeting and it didn't go very well ."
sadness,I don't understand of myself . It seems they have to save money .
sadness,It's really there ? This all seems so surreal-like it's all one big nightmare .
sadness,Oh . I just can ’ t forget it .
sadness,But we just drove across town . Can't we just go in to see him one last ...
sadness,I just had a terrible week .
sadness,I'm sorry . I forget all about it .
sadness,I have been looking forward to this performance all month .
sadness,Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already .
sadness,I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off .
sadness,I just had a terrible week .
sadness,"It ’ s getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw ."
sadness,He never came .
sadness,"I wouldn ’ t exactly characterize it in that way . I think something happened . Something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to ... what if he showed up , took one look at me and left ?"
sadness,Bummer . I guess we're both out of luck .
sadness,I feel pity for the old man .
sadness,Nothing really .
sadness,I lost all my lottery winnings playing the stock market .
sadness,My condolences .
sadness,"I'm sorry for that , I'm going to check with the chef right now . Miss , I just checked with the kitchen , and they said your order will be coming right up next . Oh , here comes ."
sadness,"Miss , I'm very sorry for the delay , please enjoy this . Free a glass of wine for inconvenience . Again I'm terribly sorry to make you wait so long ."
sadness,"Yes , I'm serious . I'm really sorry about missing your concert ."
sadness,"Yeah , but that's not why I am upset . I just found out another guy got a promotion . He doesn't know how to do anything . He sits there and kisses the managers butt all day long ."
sadness,Maybe you're right .
sadness,"I just started , but the job market is very bad right now . I'm not optimistic about it ."
sadness,"I don't know . She always said I didn't love her , but I did ."
sadness,"I have asked for a talk again , but she refused and said she wanted to be quiet ."
sadness,His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again .
sadness,I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy .
sadness,My drives were terrible today . I kept slicing the ball into the roughs and sand traps .
sadness,"Well , my mum lost her job yesterday ."
sadness,The supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole .
sadness,"Well , he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band . And one night last weekend , he came home really late , way past his curfew ."
sadness,What a pity ! You can't join us .
sadness,She said it was because we had very different ideas about life .
sadness,I lost the table tennis game yesterday .
sadness,How upsetting ! He has been away for a week !
sadness,"Yeah , I know , but it's too hard to do ."
sadness,But I still love you .
sadness,I knew this would happen some day ...
sadness,"Well . It ’ s not all my fault , Anna ..."
sadness,"Worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days ."
sadness,Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced .
sadness,I ’ Ve just parted with my boyfriend .
sadness,"That ’ s just it , I ’ m not happy anymore , Tim . It ’ s not you , it ’ s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !"
sadness,"Baby , come on . Don ’ t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ’ t leave me ."
sadness,"I fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . I'm really sorry ."
sadness,I'm afraid I can't go to the pictures with you tomorrow .
sadness,"Definitely , I ’ m really sorry ."
sadness,That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather .
sadness,I can't . I am really behind of my work .
sadness,My dissertation . I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now .
sadness,"Yes , I kept on typing it until midnight , but it is lost ."
sadness,I didn't sleep a wink last night .
sadness,How horrible !
sadness,"Sorry , I've got people coming over tomorrow night ."
sadness,"Sure.Hey , I'm sorry , but I've got to get going ."
sadness,I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us .
sadness,I knew this would happen some day ...
sadness,I ’ m very sorry .
sadness,Take care ! I will miss you so much .
sadness,"Oh , my God ! I feel nothing is going smooth ."
sadness,I miss grandma . I dreamed about her yesterday .
sadness,"Unfortunately , I missed a chance to see a classic movie ."
sadness,"unfortunately , he wasn't able to evacuate in time . He ended up dying in the tower ."
sadness,"I know you don't hear me right know , please calm down . Anyway , I don't wanna part . I'll drop by tomorrow ."
sadness,That's not fair . We had fun . Give me a second chance . Can we meet tomorrow night for drinks at the pub ?
sadness,"Dam it , I'm running out of money again , I really need to balance my budget and handle my money better ."
sadness,It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer .
sadness,The food wasn't all that exciting .
sadness,"Oh , that's too bad ."
sadness,I should have booked the tickets in advance .
sadness,We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet .
sadness,I'm now on the Songshan airport getting ready for departure . I realized that I might have left my watch .
sadness,"Doctor , I slipped and fell on my way to school . The ground is so slippery from the snow . It seems I can't move my left arm now ."
sadness,It started yesterday . I didn't eat any supper .
sadness,I'm afraid I've got a terrible cold . What should I do ?
sadness,"Very badly , doctor ."
sadness,I've got a headache and sore throat .
sadness,"Doctor , save my baby , please"
sadness,I feel itchy ! I can ’ t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak .
sadness,"Doctor , I have the worst toothache !"
sadness,My stress level is pretty much what is usually is .
sadness,It seems to me like I may have caught a bug .
sadness,I feel like maybe I am coming down with the flu .
sadness,I guess that ’ s what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day .
sadness,My mother just passed away last Tuesday .
sadness,"Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times ."
sadness,"Mr . Wang , I want to apologize for being late again this morning . I just can't get up in time for work ."
sadness,"I really can't work overtime . Because my husband has been ill recently , I must take care of him ."
sadness,Silly me .
sadness,You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first .
sadness,I don't think you really want to hear about it .
sadness,Very sorry that I have caused you so much trouble .
sadness,"Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff ."
sadness,I really feel sorry for that rhumba boy if he ever identifies himself .
sadness,Working at weekend is something I hate to do most .
sadness,"You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation ."
sadness,"Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it ."
sadness,"Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it ."
sadness,"Mr . Division , I am so sorry to have kept you waiting ."
sadness,"Oh dear , I forgot to bring it ."
sadness,I got fired .
sadness,"I'm sorry , sir ."
sadness,"You don't have to keep saying that , Yuri . It's not your fault.But me--I'm the one who should be sorry.It was me who suggested operations here in the first place ! Oh , what can we do ?"

sadness,"When my grandfather died I was extremely sad.  However my family members did not have any special feelings, they said that he was already 80 years old."
sadness,"I had been separated from my girlfriend for about a year.  On her birthday I put a present in her mailbox.  I had spent two days choosing a suitable present for her.  I waited for a few days and there was no reply from her; at last I received a thank-you card in my mailbox.  On the card there was only my name, the words thank-you  and her signature.  I was very sad then."

fear,"The music-master wrote a work, in twenty-five volumes, about the artificial bird, which was very learned and very long, and full of the most difficult Chinese words; yet all the people said they had read it, and understood it, for fear of being thought stupid and having their bodies trampled upon."

fear,"The straw therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal, who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the newly-built bridge."
fear,"The coal slipped after her, hissed when she got into the water, and breathed her last."
fear,"But the little peasant said: ""Oh, but I must have my beast back again."""
fear,"Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: ""Thank heaven, you are back again!"
fear,"There is such a storm, it looks as if the world were coming to an end."""
fear,"Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and bidden to say from whence his wealth came."
fear,"The peasant said: ""They want to make me mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it."""
fear,"Then the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks shook."
fear,"The bird hastened to fetch some water, but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable to recover himself, he was drowned."
fear,"""Creep in,"" said the witch, ""and see if it is properly heated, so that we can put the bread in."""
fear,"In the night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right hand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside, and then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child""s head off."

fear,"The princess heard him snorting and growling; she was terrified, and she cried, ""Ah, the bear is behind us and wants to get thee!"""
fear,"He might certainly have found a good bed on the soft moss, but the fear of wild beasts let him have no rest there, and at last he was forced to make up his mind to spend the night in a tree."
fear,"After he had spent some hours in the darkness, not without fear and trembling, he saw at a very short distance the glimmer of a light, and as he thought that a human habitation might be there, where he would be better off than on the branches of a tree, he got carefully down and went towards the light."
fear,"The tailor did not know what to do, or whither to turn, in order to get out of this desert and back to human beings again."
fear,"Now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it; and as he saw three of them striding about, he thought to himself, ""I can only save myself by feigning to be asleep""; so he laid himself down as if he were in a sound sleep."
fear,"Then the witch herself took it into the kitchen to be dressed; and when it was ready she could not wait till it was carried up, but took a few leaves immediately and put them in her mouth, and scarcely were they swallowed when she lost her own form and ran braying down into the court in the form of an ass."
fear,"Now the servant-maid came into the kitchen, and seeing the salad ready, was going to carry it up; but on the way she too felt a wish to taste it as the old woman had done, and ate some leaves; so she also was turned into an ass and ran after the other, letting the dish with the salad fall on the ground."
fear,"So she ate of it, and like the others ran off into the court braying away."
fear,"""What""s the matter?"" said the miller."
fear,"He thought to himself, ""If the giant sees me going in, my life will not be worth much."""
fear,So she ran home and told him all.
fear,"Then the eldest son said, ""I will soon find it"": and he went to the sick king, and begged that he might go in search of the Water of Life, as it was the only thing that could save him."
fear,"The soldier saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them; but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest princess, and she cried out to her sisters, ""All is not right; someone took hold of my gown."""
fear,"Already many men had gone into the castle, but as yet none had come out again."
fear,"When he was just going to shut his eyes, however, the bed began to move of its own accord, and went over the whole of the castle."
fear,"But whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a horse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a cord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away."
fear,"So the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some water, but the other six ran with him."
fear,"""Perhaps some accident has befallen him,"" said the king, and the next day he sent out two more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed away."
fear,"Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: ""Scour the whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all three."""
fear,"When the huntsman saw that, he went back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the water."
fear,"The king sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but they did not find him."
fear,"""Nothing nothing,"" he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the man might not see it."
fear,"He took his pockethandkerchief and tied it round his head, in order that the man might not see it."
fear,"He answered: ""Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad sore place on my head."""
fear,"He again said: ""I may not, I have a sore head."""
fear,"But he would not, and said that it would be a very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light should fall upon him his enchantment would become still worse, for he should be changed into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven long years."
fear,"Then the sister cried out, ""Pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will become a wolf, and devour me."""
fear,"The little sister, however, was dreadfully frightened when she saw that her fawn was hurt."
fear,"The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her."
fear,"There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was grown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided for."
fear,"Where have you been?"""
fear,"Then she asked if he required any huntsmen, and if he would take all of them into his service."
fear,"The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her."
fear,"At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes had never yet beheld, came to her; but the king""s son began to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her."
fear,"""That I may smoke one more pipe on my way."""
fear,"""Shake me, shake me, I pray; my apples, one and all, are ripe,"" it cried."
fear,"The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails: and the maid, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a light."
fear,"Then the parson himself was frightened; and thinking the cow was surely bewitched, told his man to kill her on the spot."
fear,"""Will you be easy?"" said the wolf; ""you""ll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter."""
fear,"""Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!"""
fear,"When he had made two snips, he saw the little Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying: ""Ah, how frightened I have been!"
fear,"But the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house, and cried out as before:"
fear,"Now Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd""s old three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air."
fear,"So he left her by herself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would tear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to her fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her."
fear,"Then poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear; and the wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm."
fear,"In the evening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for her little feet would carry her no further."
fear,By and by in came the masters of the cottage.
fear,"But the queen, now that she thought Snowdrop was dead, believed that she must be the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass and said:"
fear,"And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that had passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to anyone."
fear,"Then she dressed herself up as a peasant""s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs"" cottage, and knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and said, ""I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not."""
fear,"Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for the apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she could wait no longer."
fear,"When the two heard that, they were frightened to death, and ran away in great haste."
fear,"I was dreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squire""s pig."
fear,"So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged their pardon."
fear,"This frightened him dreadfully, and away he ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the leg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the cock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might."
fear,"But she was afraid of her step-mother, and entreated the King to let her stay just this one night more in the forest castle."

fear,"The day before the university results came out I was both excited and scared.  If I failed I did not know what I would do as I did not want to work, my family was ambivalent."
fear,"My friend and I had offended our classmate unintenionally.  We wanted to apologize to her so we decided to visit her.  We knew that she was stubborn so we were frightened.  When we rang her door bell, our fear was at it's climax"
fear,"I was camping in an old broken hut which had no lights.  I had brought along a lamp which was not working very well.  The door made strange sounds and I was sure that strange things were happening.  The most terrifying bit was that there were many wardrobes in the hut and everytime that I looked in the glass of the wardrobe I felt that there were \objects\"" behind me.   The á|whole night was spent in fear and restlessness."""
fear,"One day when I was a little boy, my friends asked me to play with them outside and to catch some boys.  However our parents did not know that we were out and when I got home it was very late and I feared being scolded by my parents."
fear,The exam was drawing near and I wanted to prepare for it.  But I had a lot of other things to do so I did not have much time to prepare  for the exams.  Whenever I sat down to study I was scared that I would  not be able to finish it.
fear,The day the results of the certificate exam came out.  I went to school and at first I did not feel frightened.  By the time I reached the fourth floor ( the results were being given on the fifth floor) I found it difficult to walk and felt that I would die.
fear,I was on a trip to Phillipines during Summer and I was staying in a hotel.  The room I was staying in was very silent and had very dim lights.  The last night I felt frightened and lay awake - I could hear some sounds around me and dared not open my eyes - I waited for dawn.
fear,"One camping night, I listened to the ghost stories told by my classmates."

anger,"And to this day, if you meet Nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout--"
anger,"There was a smothered noise--""Shut up!"" said Mr. Piperson."
anger,"Mr. Piperson pulled off the other boot and flung it after the first, there was again a curious noise-- ""Be quiet, will ye?"" said Mr. Piperson."
anger,"Sally Henny Penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out change, and she insists on being paid cash; but she is quite harmless."
anger,"""Simpkin,"" said the tailor, ""where is my TWIST?"""
anger,"And another sang--""Little bita bread and-NO-cheese!"
anger,"But when the other squirrels heard that song, they rushed upon Timmy Tiptoes and cuffed and scratched him, and upset his bag of nuts."
anger,"Timmy rolled over and over, and then turned tail and fled towards his nest, followed by a crowd of squirrels shouting-- ""Who's-been digging-up MY-nuts?"""
anger,"Like a ferocious animal, one of them rose out of his sleep and uttered a horrible cry, and gave his comrade a violent dig in the ribs with his pointed elbow, and this one turned round in his sleep: ""Be quiet, monster- sleep!"
anger,"You can snore; you are snoring the whole night, and I hardly a quarter of an hour!"""
anger,"""Get away; don't come so near me,"" said the garter, ""you appear to me quite like a man."""
anger,"Under the shield of the Pope, the law cannot reach thee; but Jens Glob shall reach thee!"""
anger,"I must get higher yet; I feel a great restlessness and longing."""
anger,"""Well, then, why do you lie in my way?"" she retorted, ""you must not be so touchy."
anger,"""Impertinent creature!"" exclaimed the Portuguese duck: ""would you compare me with the cat- that beast of prey?"
anger,"Ignorance upon ignorance indeed!"""
anger,Is there such a bird in my empire? and even in my garden?
anger,"But now she had to come out, and they tugged at her, and pulled her about, and ate her up."
anger,"""You must not shout so,"" said the sentry."
anger,"""Stop! stop!"" and the words came quite clear, though they were like the croak of a frog, or the wail of a bird."
anger,"Then they all got excited; they hit out with their wings, pecked with their beaks, and flop! one after another was thrown out of the nest."
anger,"They buzzed round the prince and stung his face and hands; angrily he drew his sword and brandished it, but he only touched the air and did not hit the gnats."
anger,"But the buckwheat spread itself out with pride, and said, ""Stupid tree; he is so old that grass grows out of his body."""
anger,"Towards morning he crept out of his hiding-place, feeling in a very bad temper with the climate."
anger,This vexes me more than anything.
anger,"He admitted that the pigeons, large and white and shining like mother-o'-pearl, looked like a kind of weather-cock; but they were fat and stupid, and all their thoughts and endeavours were directed to filling themselves with food, and besides, they were tiresome things to converse with."
anger,"""Everything is very stupid,"" the weather-cock said to himself."
anger,"""The yard cock lays no eggs, and I am too lazy to do so; if I liked, I could lay a wind-egg."
anger,But the world is not worth even a wind-egg.
anger,"His first feeling was one of anger, and then his spirits sank below zero."
anger,"""You bad boy! how did you entice her out?"
anger,"""You wicked boy! the poor little creature!"" was all she could utter."
anger,"""I don't want to fly,"" said one of the young storks, creeping back into the nest."
anger,"""I don't care about going to warm countries."""
anger,"""There,"" cried he, ""now you cannot make a fool of me again;"" and then he went home."
anger,"""You shall pay for this,"" said Great Claus, as soon as he got into the highroad, ""that you shall, Little Claus."""
anger,"""First, I killed all my horses, and then my old grandmother, and it is all your fault; but you shall not make a fool of me any more."""
anger,"""'Snik, snak, snurre, bassellurre!"
anger,"""Yes, we have my boy,"" she retorted."
anger,"""Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,"" said he, and he seated himself with her at the table."
anger,"Then the step-mother was still more enraged, and thought of nothing but how to do every possible injury to the man""s daughter, whose beauty, however, grew daily greater."
anger,"Then he was very angry, and went without his supper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into his cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have run out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell down on his head, and killed him on the spot."
anger,"""Open the door, my princess dear, Open the door to thy true love here!"
anger,"And mind the words that thou and I said By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade."""
anger,"""Open the door, my princess dear, Open the door to thy true love here!"
anger,"The mother, however, said: ""Now go and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast""s stomach with them while he is still asleep."""
anger,"Here she was to stay for seven years without meat or drink, and die of hunger."
anger,"The mayor, however, said: ""But my servant must go first."""
anger,"When she came to the merchant in the town, he did not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others came, he did not give them so much, and said: ""What can I do with all these skins?"""
anger,"Then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus outwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this treachery before the major."
anger,"The two elder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor ants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs."
anger,"Go to the fish at once!"""
anger,"The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him."
anger,"The faster he played, the more violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground."
anger,"Then a vise was brought, and the bear put his claws in it, and the little tailor screwed it tight, and said, ""Now wait until I come with the scissors,"" and he let the bear growl as he liked, and lay down in the corner on a bundle of straw, and fell asleep."
anger,"""Who are you, and what do you want?"" asked the man in a grumbling voice."
anger,"Then the old woman said, ""Now is the time for getting the bird""s heart."""
anger,"""Now you shall be paid for your roguery,"" said he; and tied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till he came to a mill and knocked at the window."
anger,"Then the huntsman said, ""Give the old one stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who was the servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give the youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and no stripes"": for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten."
anger,"""God be with you,"" he cried again, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went back to their fighting."
anger,"""Ah! wretch that I am!"" sighed she; ""why did I not marry King Grisly-beard?"""
anger,"""That is no business of mine,"" said the fiddler: ""why should you wish for another husband?"
anger,"Then he went out and cut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made her fingers very sore."
anger,"The king was at first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish."
anger,"When they came to the sea, they got into a ship and during their voyage the two eldest said to themselves, ""Our brother has got the water which we could not find, therefore our father will forsake us and give him the kingdom, which is our right""; so they were full of envy and revenge, and agreed together how they could ruin him."
anger,"She carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the boy""s father, ""Your boy,"" cried she, ""has been the cause of a great misfortune!"
anger,"""What wicked tricks are these?"" said he."
anger,I am quite innocent.
anger,He was standing there by night like one intent on doing evil.
anger,"""Learn what you will,"" spoke the father, ""it is all the same to me."
anger,"At this he grew angry, and said: ""If you will not take care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with you,"" and he hung them up again each in his turn."
anger,"""No,"" answered he, ""how should I know?"
anger,"Towards midnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it, something cried suddenly from one corner: ""Au, miau! how cold we are!"""
anger,"""You fools!"" cried he, ""what are you crying about?"
anger,"The dead man, however, got up and cried: ""Now will I strangle you."""
anger,"Then he led him by dark passages to a smith""s forge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground."
anger,"Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil with one blow, and in it caught the old man""s beard."
anger,"One day he said to himself, ""What shall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another; and for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect."""
anger,"""Surely,"" said he, ""the whole seven must have forgotten themselves over some game of play""; and when he had waited still longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished them all turned into ravens."
anger,"""Thou hast misled me finely,"" said he; ""I wanted to fetch the other lamb, and the country folks surprised me, and have beaten me to a jelly."""
anger,"But she said she supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she could not stay there all day waiting for them."
anger,"They ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, ""Kate, I hope you locked the door safe when you came away."""
anger,"""No,"" said the boy, ""I will not do that; the king has forbidden it,"" and ran away."
anger,"In the evening Iron Hans came back, looked at the boy, and said: ""What has happened to the well?"""
anger,"Such a thing as that had never yet come under the king""s notice, and he said: ""When you come to the royal table you must take your hat off."""
anger,"Go quickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest."""
anger,"When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and led the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jib, hobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark forest."
anger,"And then he was still more ridiculed."""
anger,"The king grew angry, and said: ""That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell his name."""
anger,"But when he was riding off with it, the king""s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near him that he wounded the youth""s leg with the point of his sword."
anger,"She, however, called him a fool, and said, ""What good will all the riches on earth do me, if I am to sit on this saddle?"
anger,"Thou hast wished me on it, so thou must help me off."""
anger,"""Is that all?"" said the fox."
anger,"""Behave well, Hans."""
anger,"""That was ill done, Hans, you should have cast friendly eyes on her."""
anger,"""Good evening,"" growled she, and pretended to be quite friendly."
anger,"But the clever servant had placed himself in the bed instead of his master, and when the maid came there, he tore off from her the mantle in which she had wrapped herself, and chased her out with rods."
anger,"The witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the well, and went away."
anger,"""Late at night, when the king""s daughter is in bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servant""s work for me."""
anger,"""Strike down to earth that false judge there, and his constable, and spare not the king who has treated me so ill."""
anger,"She is the very image of my dead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole earth, and you say there must be a queen."""
anger,"When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began to rake the ashes, the cook said, ""Let that alone till the morning, and heat the king""s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but take care you don""t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of never eating again."""
anger,"The king ordered the man to be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he could before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked upon as guilty and executed."
anger,"So they came back and whispered softly to him, saying, ""Now let us have no more of your roguish jokes; but throw us out some of the money."""
anger,"But the parson said, ""Woman, thou art surely mad!"""
anger,"""The others are there,"" she thought, ""I may as well be there too,"" and ran to them; but as soon as she had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her."
anger,"Then Dummling asked once more for his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom everyone called Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he made a new condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain of bread."
anger,"""As soon as you come sailing back in it,"" said he, ""you shall have my daughter for wife."""
anger,"And when she kept on begging, she said at last, to get rid of her, ""I will throw this dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in two hours"" time you have picked them all out, you shall go to the feast too."""
anger,"But the sparrow answered, ""Not wretch enough yet!"" and perched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too."
anger,"""Not wretch enough yet!"" said the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him too."
anger,"""Alas! miserable wretch that I am!"" cried he."
anger,"With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet, and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the window."
anger,"When she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to one of her servants, and said, ""Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood, that I may never see her any more."""
anger,"The third, ""Who has been picking my bread?"""
anger,"The fourth, ""Who has been meddling with my spoon?"""
anger,"The fifth, ""Who has been handling my fork?"""
anger,"Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that Snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned comb."
anger,"Just as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in the courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was come, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a broomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dininghall."
anger,"When the young wrens heard that, they were frightfully angry, and screamed: ""No, that we are not!"
anger,"When the fox felt the first string, he started so that he one leg, from pain, but he bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could hold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs."
anger,"Then the willow-wren flew to the bear""s hole and cried: ""Growler, you are to come to the nest to my children, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your body shall be broken."""
anger,"The young wife scolded him, but he said nothing and only sighed."
anger,"But about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were out and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in too great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than the rest, went to see what was going on."
anger,"Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve his late companion some trick."
anger,"At last he went to the judge, and complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his back and a fiddle hung round his neck."
anger,"""No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you."" said the countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the matter short by ordering him off to the gallows."
anger,"The fact was, he could not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf""s third gift."
anger,"At the second note the hangman let his prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first bar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and all the people who had followed to look on."
anger,"Then he called to the miser, and said, ""Tell us now, you vagabond, where you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,"" ""I stole it,"" said the miser in the presence of all the people; ""I acknowledge that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly."""

anger,"I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard !"
anger,"When I was your age , my parents didn ’ t have central heating like you do ! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . We used it to cook , heat the house and even dry our clothes ! We never caught a cold . You should be grateful !"
anger,I feel itchy ! I can ’ t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak .

anger,"Yes , and hurry up !"
anger,"Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse ."
anger,That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch .
anger,And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ?
anger,Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
anger,"I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ?"
anger,"Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before ."

anger,Excuse me ! I don't have time to waste . I've been here almost one full hour !
anger,"But it is ! Take this morning for example . The subway was so packed this morning , I got totally squished by about a hundred busy commuters on the way to work ."
anger,Why didn ’ t you just answer my question directly ? Why would Chinese answer questions this way ? I simply asked if you did it or not . It ’ s a very simple question . And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer .
anger,What a terrible house !
anger,I'll never ever work together with him !
anger,They soud like the neighbours from hell !
anger,"They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment ."

anger,But the reservation keeps the car here . That ’ s why you have the reservation .
anger,"Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car ."
anger,"What does that have to do with those men shooting at us ? Most importantly , why did you lie to me !"
anger,"Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops ."
anger,"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !"

anger,But didn't you tell him you had an appointment ?
anger,And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
anger,"It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up !"
anger,"No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her with another man at a club near my home !"
anger,I'll beat him .
anger,Why not ?
anger,When I quarrel with my husband . He didn't even try to cool me out .
anger,I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me .
anger,To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
anger,"I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it !"
anger,"This ref needs glasses . Hey ref , open your eyes ! I can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that !"
anger,You only say that because you don't have to work with him.The people in your department seem so capable and nice to be around.Take Mary for example.She ' s smart and enthusiastic . I've never met anyone as cheery as she is .
anger,"Yikes ! you are joking , right ? I can't believe it . No wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately . I thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments . What big shoes to fill !"
anger,"Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance ."
anger,I can't bear you anymore . I am sick of your drinking . I am divorcing you .
anger,"I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored ."
anger,Fine ! I ’ ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . Are you happy now ?
anger,I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !
anger,"well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did ."
anger,"the thing is , this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't ."
anger,"you said it . Good beer , good music , and on top of that , there are so many hot girls here !"
anger,how dare you !
anger,She made another white crack about my clothes .
anger,"Because I'm the wrong sex , of course !"
anger,"May , look at this mess ! You threw waste everywhere ."
anger,Stop picking on me . I am going to be mad .
anger,We are through .
anger,"How many chances have I given you , I've given up on you ."
anger,I just don't trust you any more .
anger,"Go on your vacation with Mark and when you come back , why don't you just move in with him as well !"
anger,"After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together ."
anger,Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case .
anger,See you .
anger,How should I know ? It's just kind of cold in the middle . It just doesn't taste right . Do you want to try it ?
anger,"Here is the thing . I was woke up by strange noises of the telephone several times last night . Even I unplugged it , it wouldn't stop beeping . I am also not satisfied with the housekeeping service in my room . So I want to change to a cleaner and quieter room ."
anger,"Well , I hate to disturb you , but I really can't stand it any more . Can you change my room for me ? It's too noisy . I was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . It was too much for me ."
anger,"Oh , how annoying !"
anger,I have a complaint to make . I've just been badly treated by a rude maid .
anger,This is outrageous ! I'm never coming back to this hotel again !
anger,This is highway robbery . I've got a good mind to call the police !
anger,"Well , now I've seen it all ! What a rip-off this place is !"
anger,"No , we got no receipt , but we paid on the spot ."
anger,"I can wait , but my toothache can't !"
anger,"I've told him how to do that several times , but he's never listened to me ."
