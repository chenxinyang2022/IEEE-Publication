56018,"Half way up, Cottontail was sitting in her doorway, with four or five half- grown little rabbits playing about her; one black and the others brown.",neutral
56027,It was at the top of a steep bank; the rocks and bushes overhung it.,neutral

56308,"Mrs. Tabitha went up and down all over the house, mewing for Tom Kitten.",neutral
56310,"She went right upstairs and looked into the attics, but she could not find him anywhere.",neutral

56323,"Where have you looked for him?""",neutral
56339,Ribby and Tabitha searched and searched.,neutral
56359,"""A rolling pin?"" said Ribby.",neutral
56362,Sure enough the roly-poly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor.,neutral
56366,Tom Kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard.,neutral
56367,"When he saw that his mother was going to bake, he determined to hide.",neutral
56369,"The fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot; but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks.",neutral
56373,So there was plenty of room for a little Tom Cat.,neutral
56376,Tom Kitten coughed and choked with the smoke; he could hear the sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fireplace down below.,neutral
56392,"""This seems funny,"" said Tom Kitten.",neutral
56399,"He groped his way carefully for several yards; he was at the back of the skirting board in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the picture.",neutral
56400,"All at once he fell head over heels in the dark, down a hole, and landed on a heap of very dirty rags.",neutral
56411,". . . his coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with string in very hard knots.",neutral
56422,He made a second journey for the rolling pin.,neutral
56424,"He could hear Ribby and Tabitha talking, but they were too busy lighting the candle to look into the chest.",neutral
56426,Anna Maria went down by way of skirting board and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough.,neutral
56427,She borrowed a small saucer and scooped up the dough with her paws.,neutral
56433,It did not offer to assist him.,neutral
56441,The rats each held an end.,neutral
56453,So it happened that by the time John Joiner had got the plank up-- there was nobody here under the floor except the rolling pin and Tom Kitten in a very dirty dumpling!,neutral
56461,"And when I was going to the post late in the afternoon--I looked up the land from the corner, and I saw Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the run, with big bundles on a little wheelbarrow, which looked very much like mine.",neutral
56465,"She seemed to know her way, and she seemed to have a quantity of luggage.",neutral
56468,"After that, there were no more rats for a long time at Tabitha Twitchit's.",neutral
56480,Once upon a time there was a frog called Mr. Jeremy Fisher; he lived in a little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond.,neutral
56481,The water was all slippy-sloppy in the larder and in the back passage.,neutral
56495,"His rod was a tough stalk of grass, his line was a fine long white horse-hair, and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end.",neutral
56505,There was a bite almost directly; the float gave a tremendous bobbit!,neutral
56522,"And instead of a nice dish of minnows, they had a roasted grasshopper with lady-bird sauce, which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but _I_ think it must have been nasty!",neutral
56528,One morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the doll's perambulator.,neutral
56533,"A minute afterwards, Hunca Munca, his wife, put her head out, too; and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery, she ventured out on the oilcloth under the coal-box.",neutral
56534,The doll's-house stood at the other side of the fire-place.,neutral
56536,They pushed the front door--it was not fast.,neutral
56548,"The ham broke off the plate with a jerk, and rolled under the table.",neutral
56562,"After pulling half the feathers out of Lucinda's bolster, she remembered that she herself was in want of a feather bed.",neutral

56657,Why!,neutral
56665,"They made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water to Owl Island to gather nuts.",neutral
56673,"A little wee man, in a red red coat!",neutral
56677,"The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening.",neutral
56678,"But next morning they all came back again to Owl Island; and Twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of Old Brown's doorway, and said--",neutral
56680,"But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old Mr. Brown with a NETTLE and singing--",neutral
56687,"And you cannot gather a bowl-full!""",neutral
56691,They paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on Owl Island.,neutral
56697,"On the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in PLUM-PUDDING for Old Brown.",neutral
56698,"Each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dockleaf, fastened with a pine-needle- pin.",neutral
56702,"Which was ridiculous of Nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to Old Brown.",neutral
56705,They had stolen it out of a bumble BEES' nest on the tippity top of the hill.,neutral
56719,But still he did not speak.,neutral
56728,"Nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the WIND, and he took a running jump right onto the head of Old Brown!",neutral
56739,"She had eight of a family: four little girl pigs, called Cross-patch, Suck-suck, Yock-yock and Spot; and four little boy pigs, called Alexander, Pigling Bland, Chin-Chin and Stumpy.",neutral
56773,"I pinned the papers, for safety, inside their waistcoat pockets; Aunt Pettitoes gave to each a little bundle, and eight conversation peppermints with appropriate moral sentiments in screws of paper.",neutral

56790,Stole a pig?,neutral
56811,"He took a wrong turn--several wrong turns, and was quite lost.",neutral

56833,"He pushed the hamper into a corner, threw a sack over it to keep the hens quiet, put a pot on the fire, and unlaced his boots.",neutral
56867,In the course of the day Pigling pushed in all his remaining six peppermints.,neutral
56869,"Mr. Piperson was very affable; he slapped Pigling on the back, made lots of porridge and forgot to lock the meal chest.",neutral
56871,"He went to bed early, and told Pigling upon no account to disturb him next day before twelve o'clock.",neutral
56878,"She pointed at Pigling's plate; he hastily gave it to her, and fled to the meal chest--""How did you come here?"" asked Pigling Bland.",neutral

77745,By weight . 6.0 cents per pound .,neutral
77750,May I help you ?,neutral
77762,"You are right , sir . To prepare it , a Sichuan food chef first fries some chilli until they turn reddish brown , and then puts diced chicken breast meat into the pot with other condiments and peanuts . That's why the dish has a bright colour .",neutral
77765,What kind of cuisine do you have ?,neutral
77773,"Yes , but I don't know what soup you have .",neutral

77837,"Yes , I'm sure I've done a lot of house painting in my life . And my mother was very picky . If I got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture , she would get furious . So I learned to be very careful .",neutral

77938,What's the reason that people prefer to read this one ?,neutral
77939,I think perhaps the news stories in it are truthful and accurate . It also has a special page about the stock market ; maybe this is the real reason for its popularity . Many people are now speculating in the stock market .,neutral
77950,Nothing .,neutral
77951,What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see .,neutral

78057,"Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find the right apartment there .",neutral

78330,It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .,neutral
78331,I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .,neutral

They are required to stay in the palace , waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards . Look at the king in chess , he is much more capable .",neutral
83587,"Yeah , and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards , he has a queen who is the most powerful piece . I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China .",neutral
83591,"Flip it to channel 9 , will you , Janet ? There's a big basketball game on in a couple of minutes .",neutral

83687,Excuse me . Have you got the time ?,neutral
83690,Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month .,neutral

84176,I'll see you later then .,neutral
84188,Me neither ! Would you like to go in and buy her a gift together ?,neutral
84198,"Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they are actually showing off !",neutral
84202,"What a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted by Lao She , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spending power either . Teahouses of today all feature a cozy , comfortable environment , and high-quality services , but can easily cost you a good deal — just like a coffee bar .",neutral
84208,"You lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you to your friends .",neutral

84406,The toilet flushes and the shower has hot and cold water,neutral
84413,"True , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time .",neutral
84415,"Yeah , I have the same feeling . Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . But at a wholesale market , you never know whether what you are buying are of good quality or not .",neutral
84416,That's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to .,neutral

89487,Don't forget about the dessert .,neutral

89633,OK . Anything else ?,neutral

89801,I'm from England and I'm trying to make a travel plan for today .,neutral
89802,What brings you here ?,neutral
89806,"Oh , it's not very far . And as far as I know it is a fancy place .",neutral
89815,"Dad , it makes no sense .",neutral
89820,"Oh , you see , we are on the 8th floor , and moving into the 6th floor in another building . It is about 15 kilometers to get there .",neutral
89841,That was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . I think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on .,neutral
89843,"Hi , my name is Ted , what's yours ?",neutral
89847,"Do you come here often , Laura ?",neutral
89853,"No , this is my first time here .",neutral
89880,"No , it's easy . We'll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip . They'll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund .",neutral

89892,"Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will .",neutral

104648,I think I'm going to decline . I just prefer to do my own thing .,neutral
104650,"My dad was , but not my mom .",neutral

104818,"But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?",neutral
104821,"That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .",neutral
104827,"That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .",neutral
104828,"So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?",neutral
104836,It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .,neutral
104841,Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .,neutral
104845,They were not too bad . I really liked my poli-sci class .,neutral
104846,Would you consider it your favorite class ?,neutral

104865,It's nothing . I'm just a little stressed out .,neutral
104866,Why ? What's stressing you out ?,neutral
104868,The best thing to do is study as much as you can . I'm sure you'll do alright .,neutral
104890,"That sounds like a hot job , right ? But in my opinion , you ought not to choose one career from that so-called list , and you need to take your interests , values , and skills into account .",neutral
104894,"Yes , it is . I'm Jennifer . Nice to meet you .",neutral
104903,Excuse me . May I ask you some questions ?,neutral

105020,Me too . Pride and Prejudice is my favorite .,neutral
105026,"Yeah , my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me . Or I chat with my friends through text messages .",neutral

105044,Here you are . You must return them within a month .,neutral
105046,You can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them .,neutral
105058,"Good morning , Miss .",neutral

105079,"Maybe another time . People say that boys ' dormitories are in a mess , is it true ?",neutral
105080,"In fact , our dormitory is much worse than they can be described .",neutral
105081,It's hard for me to imagine . How can you stand that ?,neutral
105087,Why are you so pessimistic ?,neutral
105096,"That is true . I ’ ll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It ’ s usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars .",neutral
105097,What's to come next ?,neutral
105111,"Well . When you review your lessons , mark the places which you don't understand , then I will give you some coaching .",neutral
105115,Where are you going ?,neutral
105120,The job market is so competitive nowadays . I want to develop some useful skills .,neutral
105131,I ’ m trying to decide what school to apply for .,neutral
105135,Which is better ?,neutral
105150,"I have to take my exams for getting into the university , so I need to prepare .",neutral
105152,"It has to ! I ’ Ve been studying every day , eight hours a day ! I don ’ t know , but the school has a great success record .",neutral
105157,"I'm sorry , but that class is already full.And also , students are supposed to register through the touch-tone registration system .",neutral
105161,"Well , I could put you on a waiting list.But that doesn't guarantee you will get into the class . What is your name ?",neutral
105162,My name is Karen Huang . That's spelled H - U - A - N - G .,neutral

105210,"Yes , I agree .",neutral
105214,Is that right ?,neutral
105215,"Yes , that's right .",neutral
105216,"Well , I hope you let me hang out with you then . Maybe I can learn from you .",neutral
105217,"Oh , certainly . Certainly . I'm always willing to help beginners.Just call me Big Brother Dave .",neutral
105225,"Well , I came to talk to you because I want to apply for a scholarship .",neutral
105227,"Thanks . I really appreciate it.In fact , I do need a letter of recommendation for this scholarship .",neutral
105228,What kind of scholarship is it ?,neutral
105231,"I'm a junior now , and my GPA is 3.92 .",neutral
105239,"Yes , but I need to write it by next week .",neutral

105262,"Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad .",neutral
105265,"Yes , I am . I am from Taiwan . I came here to study political science .",neutral
105269,Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters ?,neutral
105272,"You just said your English needs work , yes ?",neutral
105273,"Yes , that's true . Especially my writing . I think my papers aren't good enough . I make too many grammatical mistakes .",neutral
105278,Let's see ... My schedule right now is quite busy.But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange .,neutral
105283,I think it sounds like a good system . But when is it convenient to meet ?,neutral
105284,"Well , today is Monday.Actually , for me Monday at this time would be the best . I am free from now until 11",neutral
105288,And I will bring my textbook and a tape recorder . I would like to record some things so I can practice on my own .,neutral
105291,Oh ... I am really worried about the exam . I have no idea what will be on it .,neutral
105302,"There are different things you can do.For one , the university offers a special free course on note-taking.You should go to the course . Also , I am pretty good at taking notes . I can help you on this exam . I will photocopy all my notes , and you can compare them to your notes.Then maybe you will see what kinds of things to write down .",neutral
105322,Yes . Or you can bring it yourself .,neutral
105348,I will ask my friends for you.Maybe someone knows a company that needs part-time people.That ' s another thing you should do . Ask all your friends to ask around for you.You might find something .,neutral
105356,"The Card doesn't actually give you discounts on beer.But it will give you discounts on certain club cover charges.So if you want to see your favorite band at Amy's or Cosmo's Club , you get a discount on the entrance fee .",neutral
105358,Usually it's two dollars off the cover price .,neutral
105380,I ’ m speaking French . Don ’ t you know anything ?,neutral
105387,"Ms . Lee , could you tell me what number 7 is again ? I didn't catch you .",neutral
105390,I hope the teacher decides to curve our test grades .,neutral

105424,Pretty busy . I have to pick up a lot of credits this year .,neutral
105429,When is it due ?,neutral

105449,"Yes , sir .",neutral
105454,"Ok , I will get you another one .",neutral
105461,"I am , sir .",neutral

105542,Of course . There you are .,neutral
105545,Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ?,neutral
105547,"Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere .",neutral
105549,One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers .,neutral
105550,I hear you have to wear uniforms at private school .,neutral
105557,Which university should I apply to ?,neutral
105561,Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year .,neutral
105562,Are you sure you can do well this year ?,neutral
105569,Yes . I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa .,neutral

105612,Not much . I'm still living at home and commuting to school . I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about . It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped . The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count .,neutral
105613,That sounds smart ... but kind of boring .,neutral
105625,Shih ! ! Please keep your voice down . There are people reading and studying here .,neutral
105632,No . How do I get one ?,neutral
105634,Here you go .,neutral

105674,Yes . Are you ?,neutral
105676,Do you want to study together ?,neutral
105681,"Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ?",neutral
105682,"Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English .",neutral
105688,Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them .,neutral

105719,"That would have to be Miss Baymler , my fourth grade teacher .",neutral
105729,Yes . She treated us all fairly . She don ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets .,neutral
105732,Do you know what she is doing now ?,neutral
105734,Have you ever read one of the books ?,neutral
105742,"You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use .",neutral
105745,What do you think of the teacher ?,neutral
105757,"Well , yes . I don't mind admitting that I am . I enjoyed school , but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams .",neutral

105862,"Let's program your courses , since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction . You transcript indicate that your english background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it .",neutral
105865,"Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will .",neutral
105879,"It should be , but there are too many options . My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices , but after that ...",neutral
105880,"I know . You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country , a big school or a small school , a public or private school ...",neutral
105881,"Yup , you understand . And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college . They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline . And the tuition is usually pretty low .",neutral

106057,Yes . I gotta review all of them for the final exam . It is just around the corner .,neutral

106099,What are you major in ?,neutral
106101,What do you think of the literature course .,neutral
106104,"Yes , we do .",neutral

106156,I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries . I like the culture .,neutral
106157,Right.It ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well .,neutral
106159,What do you like to do with your free time ?,neutral
106166,"Yes , I think so , If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course .",neutral
106174,Not always.Sometimes we don't understand her.Then she has to repeat what she said .,neutral
106178,Sometimes it's difficult.Some words look different from the way one pronounces them .,neutral
106180,You can't help learning when you're using it all day.You ' ll see . A few weeks ' study in the school will have a similar effect on you .,neutral
106181,"I hope so.You see , at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . I'm awfully worried , I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect .",neutral

106219,She's another antique .,neutral
106225,You're got a point there . But do you think he's a little absent-minded ?,neutral
106226,I guess so .,neutral
106227,I don't think the teacher had a right to say that . The teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class .,neutral
106228,"You've got to be joking ! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants , and if she saw Myra cheating , she certainly had the right to say so .",neutral
106229,"I agree she had the right to say something , but I feel she should have done it privately .",neutral
106230,"You're right . If I were the teacher , I wouldn't have done that .",neutral
106231,Why did the teacher criticise Myra in front of the whole class ?,neutral
106241,What do your classmates think of it ?,neutral
106243,How long will you study there .,neutral
106246,Chicago University . My major is Economics .,neutral
106264,"Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ?",neutral

106498,Our maths teacher is rather humorous .,neutral
106508,What do you think of your teacher ?,neutral

106565,I just bought a new atlas . I ’ m looking this map of the world . Look at Russia ! That ’ s a vast country .,neutral
106570,The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .,neutral
106575,It seems you have late fees .,neutral

106658,Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me .,neutral
106671,Sign me up for Monday and Wednesday .,neutral
106673,Can you tell me what the date and time of our field trip is ?,neutral
106674,We are leaving on our science field trip at 8 a . m . next Monday . Do you have something to write that down on ?,neutral

106725,"No problem , come on .",neutral
106726,My German teacher thought it would be a good idea to have German pen friends to write to in German .,neutral
106728,The only thing is that my pen friend will be writing in English .,neutral
106731,Maybe Olga can introduce you to some of her friends who can write to you in German and you can do the same for her with your friends to write her in English .,neutral
106737,What do you think now ?,neutral
106739,But I still say Americans spend a lot more money on useless things than we Chinese do .,neutral
106741,How long will it take to learn English ? Will I be able to take other courses next semester or will English take up all of my time ?,neutral
106746,No . You just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation . Then you go on practicing and learning outside . A lot of learning depends on your personal motivation .,neutral
106748,You said it .,neutral
106755,I never know when to shake hands and when not to . Can you tell me something about it ?,neutral
106756,Do you come from a country where they shake hands ?,neutral
106757,"Oh yes . Men , women , and children shake hands all the time .",neutral
106760,"Well , a good rule to follow is , for men you hold out your hand , for women and children , you wait and see what they do .",neutral
106766,"In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page .",neutral
106768,A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ?,neutral
106777,"I ’ Ve always wondered , what ’ s the difference between English for Chinese students and English for native students ?",neutral
106790,"It ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ?",neutral
106792,"It takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ’ t it ?",neutral
106795,I think I will continue my studies . Now it's not easy for a graduate with bachelor's degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master's or doctor's degree . We are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market .,neutral
106796,So you will continue to study for a master's degree ?,neutral
106798,How can you finance your education abroad ? It is very expensive to study abroad .,neutral
106801,"Are you ok , Chuck ? You look pale .",neutral
106804,"You did ? Do tell me . I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it , but I've made little progress !",neutral
106807,You can say that . I can actually sing some of them now .,neutral
106809,I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer .,neutral
106814,Great . Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary ?,neutral
106817,How's your time spent in the United States ?,neutral
106829,Absolutely . Now I understand why he responded that way .,neutral
106842,That's so true . It's great that we see eye to eye on this .,neutral
106859,Yeah .,neutral
106865,"Well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies .",neutral
106871,"Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia .",neutral
106872,"Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan .",neutral
106873,To me English is a difficult language .,neutral
106887,What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense .,neutral
106892,"Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .",neutral
106896,"I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it .",neutral
106900,"He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good .",neutral
106903,Where did you get that idea ?,neutral
106904,"That ’ s the impression I get from the movies , and from looking around . Men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other .",neutral
106911,"After being raised together , men and women can be business-like in each other ’ s company . It really doesn ’ t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love . Does that answer your question ?",neutral
106918,Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction . It's hard work .,neutral
106919,I don't mind the work . I think it's worthwhile .,neutral
106930,You hit the nail right on the head .,neutral
106931,"Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ?",neutral
106943,I'm majoring in English .,neutral
106944,Is it difficult to learn ?,neutral
106949,You're right .,neutral
106951,You can't help learning when you're using it all day . You'll see . A few weeks ' study in the school will have a similar effect on you .,neutral
106954,"You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use .",neutral
106956,There are hundreds and hundreds . English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .,neutral
106966,Look . Here are the core classes . Everyone has to take them .,neutral
106971,"Excuse me , I need your assistance .",neutral
106976,I know where the C building is .,neutral
106987,"Yes , I guess basic speaking in the English is easier .",neutral
106994,"Sadly , I hardly ever speak to English people . I usually practice with my Chinese friends .",neutral
106995,Do you mind helping me ?,neutral
106997,I'm not sure how to find my next class .,neutral
107002,Do you know what the room number is ?,neutral
107004,My next class is around there .,neutral
107022,"Well , when you have that , you can take it over to the bookstore . Can you find it ?",neutral
107042,"Yes , I know a great place . What types of food do you like ?",neutral
107049,When are we leaving for our field trip ?,neutral
107058,I am going to post all of that information on the geology club web page . Check it out when you get a chance . See you Monday !,neutral
107061,"Maybe just a quick sandwich , salad , or something .",neutral
107067,"Hi , could you help me find a place where I could buy some lunch ?",neutral
107068,Sure ! What kind of food would you like ?,neutral
107071,Good ! Where is it ?,neutral
107097,I hope it works !,neutral
107104,First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot . The dollars have to be smooth .,neutral

107117,Do you know if the parking structure is full or not ?,neutral
107128,Perfect ! Do you know the hours and rules for the library ?,neutral
107133,I want to know how to buy something from this machine .,neutral
107140,Just remember that you might have to feed the money in a couple of times to get it to work .,neutral
107148,You can park in the student parking structure .,neutral
107150,You'll find the parking structure on the west side of the campus .,neutral
107159,"OK , here it is .",neutral
107162,You seem to have filled the form out all right . Are you familiar with our rules and fines ?,neutral
107163,"Yes , I know what to do .",neutral

107358,Yes . Have you ever been in one of his classes ?,neutral
107361,"I'm not sure because I really need to learn something , but I also worry about grades .",neutral
107362,"Grades are important , but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important , too ?",neutral
107369,"Professor , could I make an appointment with you ?",neutral
107371,Two o'clock would be the best time .,neutral
107374,"Remember , it is in the E building on the third floor .",neutral

107380,You have to bring me an add sheet to sign . Do you have one ?,neutral
107394,"When , exactly do you need to leave ?",neutral

107456,Are you going to go right away ?,neutral
107467,I park days and evenings .,neutral
107469,What signs ?,neutral
107471,What curb colors ?,neutral
107476,Will you be driving a motorcycle or a car ?,neutral
107487,It seems that I've been given two classes scheduled at the same time .,neutral
107492,Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day .,neutral
107502,"No , thank you .",neutral

Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , butoften times I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing .

127421,"Think of the big face down the eve , hmm .",neutral
127427,And also to frighten away evil spirits .,neutral
127429,And my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year .,neutral
127431,"Your family must be busy shopping for Christmas , now .",neutral
127451,Whose house warming party is it ?,neutral

127722,Yes ?,neutral
127725,That's right .,neutral
127729,"Several things , for example , Various coins , stamps , stones and so on .",neutral

127777,"Well , the weather is so unpredictable this time of year .",neutral
127778,You're right.We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow .,neutral
127781,The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast .,neutral

127795,Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month .,neutral
127802,Yes .,neutral

127892,You don't mind if I have one .,neutral

127949,It's too hot to read .,neutral

128002,What time are you leaving ?,neutral
128016,What's the bonus like at your company ?,neutral
128019,Maybe . But you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account .,neutral
128020,"Hey , I know what that's like . I bought a BMW on my Visa card . Now the payments really hurt .",neutral
128021,"Well , you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments . I missed a credit payment last month . Now my bank account's overdrawn , and the company is threatening to take back my purchases .",neutral

128061,Was it ?,neutral
128067,"I'm so sorry , I've been held up by the damn traffic jam for half an hour . I'd have arrived but for that .",neutral

128111,"Oh I remember , I cut terrible calls , and you didn't say anything about it .",neutral
128147,"Come on , let ’ s try it .",neutral

128157,Are you really interested in doing something ?,neutral

128192,Were you in or out ? Can you remember that ?,neutral
128194,Did you see anyone come into the block flats ?,neutral
128217,A house warming party ?,neutral
128220,"Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate 1 in this area is extremely expensive .",neutral
128223,"I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin .",neutral
128229,"Not at all . I see you and your family twice a week , and I enjoy seeing my own friends . I ’ m too busy to feel lonely !",neutral
128231,"Hello , Karl . I ’ m Chuck Jones . We ’ re going to be neighbors .",neutral
128245,I've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies ... but it looks like I'm going to need to make a claim .,neutral
128248,If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered .,neutral
128250,"Sure . Basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too .",neutral
128259,"I couldn't even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then I'd have to find my own place .",neutral
128272,"That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs .",neutral
128275,"Well , at least going to college won't be too bad . Since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college .",neutral
128282,"Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ?",neutral
128296,I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime .,neutral
128301,"No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps .",neutral
128302,"Oh , I see . Yeah . Some people like traveling , some don ’ t . My husband didn ’ t like traveling at first , either . He said what ’ s the use of traveling ? A waste of money and a waste of time.At last I got him on the move . After all , he loved me . We went to Bali , Indonesia , one of the most beautiful places in the world . That trip left a very deep impression on him . Since then whenever we have holidays and money , we ’ d like to patronize the travel agency . Isn ’ t it a bit dull to shut yourself at one place all your life ?",neutral
128303,"How good are you at sports , Bill ?",neutral
128305,Wow !,neutral
128314,And then what ?,neutral
128316,That sounds boring to me .,neutral
128317,What do you plan on doing after you retire ?,neutral
128318,"Yes , I think I will do something new . I ’ Ve always wanted to be a teacher .",neutral
128335,All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers .,neutral
128344,"Hi , Mr . Zhang . What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy . How was your date ?",neutral
128356,Have you noticed what has changed ?,neutral
128364,Wow ! Sure !,neutral
128367,I really want to pick your brain about something I've been thinking a lot about .,neutral
128369,"Well , as you know , I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far , but I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work ... maybe even get a Doctorate !",neutral
128370,Wow ! Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain .,neutral
128373,"I know education is expensive , but it's been my lifelong dream . Call me crazy , but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name .",neutral
128376,I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling . It's not as romantic as you might think .,neutral
128377,Yeah ... I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate . I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare .,neutral
128381,"Well , stress is a real thing . It's not an imaginary condition .",neutral
128382,"It's seriously affecting my life ! I can't sleep , I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered . Other people seem to handle stress okay ... why am I so weak ?",neutral
128383,"You're not weak ... you're stressed out ! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years . Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators ... and as you might imagine , that was pretty stressful .",neutral
128384,"Yeah , but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office . My stress is just about silly paperwork !",neutral
128394,"Oh ... Sure . We have an entire month ! In traditional Chinese culture , Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit .",neutral
128400,Yes ! How did you guess that ?,neutral
128403,"But no dressing up like ghosts , right ?",neutral
128404,No ! So ... is Halloween essentially the same thing as ghost month ?,neutral
128406,"Yes , I found a better house near my office . I ’ m very satisfied with it . But I ’ m worrying .",neutral
128408,"I ’ m worrying about how to move all of my household stuff . You know , I have a lot of stuff .",neutral
128409,You can call a mover .,neutral
128410,How much dose that cost ?,neutral
128422,What do you mean ?,neutral
128425,Sounds like a pyramid scheme . Have you heard of those before ?,neutral
128430,What happens then ?,neutral
128439,"I know . It is a lot of money and I haven't gotten to know any of the people celebrating their birthdays well enough yet . At our old department , it was only three dollars for each birthday and there were only ten of us .",neutral
128441,What is that ?,neutral
128453,I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs .,neutral
128463,"Not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding .",neutral
128472,What do you mean by that ?,neutral
128474,"Yes , but you only pay 800 dollars a month . Emm , it ’ s hard to decide which is better , shorter commuting time or lower rent .",neutral
128475,"I thought paying a lower rent would be better , but now I ’ m not sure .",neutral
128477,"Yes , if you consider 7-11 is a supermarket .",neutral
128489,I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years .,neutral
128491,So what's Michael Milliken up to these days ?,neutral
128492,He's giving lectures on business at colleges .,neutral
128499,"It was a big , green thing that looked like a person . It was in the kitchen , and it slowly moved towards the stairs ...",neutral
128500,So what did you do ?,neutral
128505,"Yeah , about .",neutral
128510,A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it .,neutral
128511,I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time .,neutral
128516,It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future .,neutral
128527,"Don't forget my friend Andy from the office . He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over .",neutral
128533,I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . It's only a superstition . It really doesn't mean anything .,neutral
128536,That's better .,neutral
128560,"Well , I believe it now , and when are they are getting marry ?",neutral
128561,Next june .,neutral
128578,What'd he do ?,neutral
128581,I suppose I do .,neutral
128585,It sure is .,neutral
128587,"Well , If you live in other as long enough you love them just as much .",neutral
128592,When poyou have to see her ?,neutral
128600,What does he look like ? Can people tell ?,neutral
128601,"Yes , people surely can . He ’ s whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though .",neutral
128605,I don't know.Maybe they are really crazy .,neutral
128613,"Well , it's true.The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul .",neutral
128634,"I think so.Yes , they get along so well .",neutral
128655,"Well , what about it ? As it happens I've got two tickets for next thursday evening . I thought perhaps .",neutral
128658,"Thursday ? Oh , sorry . I meant thursday too . I mean I busy then too .",neutral

128817,"These girls are different , they are not wimpy .",neutral
128819,When is the last time you talked to you parents ?,neutral
128821,Are you going to see them soon ?,neutral
128822,"I am going to go home after the holidays and we're going to have a Christmas kind of in January or February . Yeah , depending on when my brother can come in .",neutral
128826,Not particularly . I was rather disappointed .,neutral
128842,And how about your Spanish ?,neutral
128848,How well can you speak them ?,neutral
128854,Where did you learn it ?,neutral
128861,But everything has been so easy .,neutral
128864,"Okay . Have it your way , but don't say I didn't warn you .",neutral

128936,We'd better get back to work .,neutral
128937,"Yeah , I'm not too worried about Vince , but I'd hate to face Zina if we don't deliver ...",neutral
128941,Vince says he can't afford anybody else . We're got to come through .,neutral
128947,"He's just a distraction , like a mosquito buzzing in my ear . I want no distractions .",neutral

135937,"I wish our competition will quit poaching our people , when Susan resigned last week to work for the Sunburst , she was our fourth employee to leave us for them .",neutral
135938,"Have you ever considered that perhaps we have a morale problem among our employees ? If everyone is discontent with their work , of course they won't stick arround .",neutral
135942,"Our human resource department is working on it , it's not easy to recruit new employees every few month , it's hard to find qualified people .",neutral
135943,Maybe we should start shopping around the competitors people .,neutral
135957,"Did they finally fill that post , how come I haven't seen her ? She must have not been inducted yet .",neutral
135960,"If the new girl is competent , maybe they will promote her when that time comes .",neutral
135962,"Not really , do you ?",neutral
135968,Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ?,neutral

135971,"Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion .",neutral
135976,Don ’ t you think you are overreacting a little ? Calling you by nicknames shouldn ’ t be so bad ...,neutral
135978,That ’ s what you get for working in a male-dominated field . I think you ’ ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . You probably won ’ t be able to change him .,neutral

135992,"I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . Also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic .",neutral
135995,"Sure , it's easy . First of all , the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple . People are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans . Stick to about three or four points , give an overview of the points , then present them one by one , and then summarize at the end . Be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered .",neutral
135997,"You should consider the size and interests of your audience . In other words , who is listening , and what do they want to hear ... you can put together a PPT with some graphics and animations that will catch people's attention , but be careful not to go overboard .",neutral
135999,"You know , stage fright is very normal , most people get nervous before they have to speak in front of large groups . Just prepare well , rehearse beforehand , and trust that you will be great ... and you will be !",neutral

136048,That's marketing research ... But what about getting started once you have an idea ?,neutral
136049,"After you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . If you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with .",neutral
136052,"I think the government needs a radical plan to improve things . The government just talks , but in the long run , nothing is done to improve the economy .",neutral
136055,The worst part is that the inflation hurts the poor more than the rich . It also leads to more unemployment in the long run . I don't know what a good solution would be to make the economy more vibrant again ...,neutral
136059,But what ?,neutral
136065,I'm sure there'll be canned ! And there also might be some legal consequences .,neutral

Please be conscanciouss about getting a hold of everyone of these leads . We've spent a big chunk of marketing budget to find these people . I don't want our investment to go down the drain .",neutral
136081,The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports .,neutral

139237,I'm sorry . I know there are still seven machines . But I'm exhausted .,neutral
139238,That's okay . Don't worry.It ' s important not to push yourself . Especially not at the beginning .,neutral
139240,"We can just go through them next time . It's no problem . Really.The most important thing is to know your limits.So if you feel burned out now , it is good to stop.Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back , then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks . Right ?",neutral
139250,"Were you so wild when you were still in Taipei , Sharon ?",neutral
139253,They're smoking pot . Don't worry about it .,neutral
139257,"Don't worry about it . It is true that pot is illegal in America.But the laws aren't as strict as in Taiwan.If people are arrested , and they have a little pot in their possession , they don't go to jail . They just have to pay a fine .",neutral
139264,I don't know if I can drink more . I already had two drinks .,neutral
139267,"It is . We study hard all week.And then , on the weekend , we party hard . That's the best way to live .",neutral
139270,Why don't you run outside ?,neutral
139275,You ?,neutral
139280,"No , not at all . I was on the swimming team in high school.And I'd like to do some weight training . They have decent equipment at that gym .",neutral
139286,So I need to do something too .,neutral
139287,But lifting weights isn't the best thing.You should do some kind of aerobic exercise .,neutral
139295,Don't worry . You don't have to do anything.All you have to do is listen . You will enjoy it .,neutral
139298,Really ?,neutral
139304,And will I go up to the front to have the bread and wine ?,neutral
139306,Eu-char-ist ? What is that ?,neutral
139308,It doesn't sound like an English word .,neutral
139312,"Karen , do you have a minute ? I'd like to ask you about something .",neutral
139314,"I think you can give me some advice.You have worked here longer , and I just want to know what you think .",neutral
139316,I am worried about the meeting this morning .,neutral
139321,"Rude ? You weren't rude at all , Annie . Why do you think you were rude ?",neutral
139323,I understand . But really you weren't rude at all.You said what you thought . I think he appreciates that .,neutral
139326,"But I am new here , and I'm not sure he is used to that .",neutral
139336,Do you mind if I put my jacket there ?,neutral
139340,"Well , there are many Chinese Americans , you know.And your English is very good . You sound like an American .",neutral
139358,"He's still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge , or whether he wants to hire an American.But even if he hires an American , I'll probably be transferred to our American office .",neutral
139365,You seem excited about it .,neutral
139370,"It takes some time.Because even if the quality is high , people won't accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name.Name recognition is crucial .",neutral
139375,"Wait , Jimmy , it ’ s cold outside . Put a hat on !",neutral
139385,"There are some things I miss . But I love Chinese food.And I think the people in Taiwan are really hospitable.Besides , I grew up in Los Angeles , so I'm used to living in crowded places.Why are you going to America ?",neutral
139386,I'm going to New York to visit my sister . She is in art school . I've never been to New York before . I'm kind of scared .,neutral
139387,Why ?,neutral
139389,"Don't worry about it.Your sister lives there . She probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go.It ' s true there are some dangerous places in big American cities.But if your sister lives there , she must know the city pretty well already .",neutral
139393,The museums are excellent . And the shopping ! Well ! I'm sure you'll spend a lot of money there .,neutral
139400,And that ?,neutral
139409,Why ?,neutral
139410,We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .,neutral
139416,"Yeah , yeah , whatever .",neutral
139420,What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family !,neutral
139423,"You ’ re right . I ’ m being crazy ! Ok , I ’ m ready , let ’ s do this !",neutral
139424,Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you .,neutral
139438,What are you talking about ? Where is your Halloween spirit ? Didn ’ t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ?,neutral
139442,"You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football .",neutral
139447,Is he ok ?,neutral
139453,What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ?,neutral
139456,What are you so excited about ?,neutral
139471,This is a really great place to watch a baseball game .,neutral
139476,Who are those guys ?,neutral
139482,"Wow , Michael Jordan ’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch .",neutral
139486,What ’ s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ?,neutral
139492,Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it .,neutral
139496,"Hi , John , how was your vacation ?",neutral
139510,Sure ! Let ’ s have some nachos and mozzarella sticks .,neutral
139512,Wait ... What !,neutral
139514,"Yeah , I ’ m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains .",neutral
139515,"Oh , do you go hiking often ?",neutral
139517,It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ?,neutral
139537,"The ref calls the players for the kick off , and here we go ! Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield , but , oath , it ’ s out of bounds .",neutral
139546,"Just hold me ... I ’ ll always be here for you , no matter what . And together , we can tackle whatever life throws at us . I believe in us , steven .",neutral
139563,"Hello everyone ! I ’ m Rick Fields , and here with me is Bob Copeland .",neutral
139571,Would you travel around the world if you had the money ?,neutral
139572,At the drop of a hat .,neutral
139574,Nothing . He's just got a chip on the shoulder .,neutral
139575,Do you think you will ever work at that company again ?,neutral
139577,That was a tough question . How did you get it right ?,neutral
139579,All of my friends are going out to the lake tonight and I'm going too !,neutral
139581,How was your business trip ?,neutral
139584,"Not at all , I was totally in the dark .",neutral
139590,"Yes , of course . Didn't you know that ?",neutral
139595,"That's why a lot of people buy cigarettes here too , isn't it ?",neutral
139609,"Yes , but you have to calculate a little.You paid fifty dollars and you fell down fifty times.So you only spent one dollar per fall . That's cheap .",neutral
139613,I saw yesterday that they rent windsurfers at the beach . I want to rent one .,neutral
139623,"No , I'm not.Hey , look at that guy over there .",neutral
139633,Why not ?,neutral
139639,Of course I'm right . I already told you the rule for Las Vegas . Remember ?,neutral
139644,Okay .,neutral
139645,So how much do you want to gamble ?,neutral
139646,Maybe 500 dollars .,neutral
139650,Now I understand . But I don't smoke or drink.So what am I supposed to buy in here ?,neutral
139653,What ? You feel sorry for the butterflies ?,neutral
139655,"Well , I agree with you . I'd rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains . I just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population .",neutral
139658,This one is 2300 dollars.Maybe I should buy it for my mother . What do you think ?,neutral
139660,"Yes , but she would like this a lot . She likes to collect little things like this .",neutral
139665,Why not fifty or one-hundred dollars ?,neutral
139670,"Slot machines ? No , I don't want that ! That's too boring . I want a game with cards or dice .",neutral
139671,So what do you want to play then ?,neutral
139679,"But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes .",neutral
139685,do you hear something ?,neutral
139686,Why did she do that ?,neutral
139692,He sounds hot ! What does he do for a living ?,neutral
139700,"Son , firecrackers aren ’ t toys.they ’ re dangerous !",neutral
139716,Did you see that ? He traveled and the ref didn ’ t call it !,neutral
139734,Yeah well it ’ s about time ! He ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years !,neutral
139746,"Oh , wait a second , you seem really familiar , I think I know you from somewhere .",neutral
139750,What do you want to do tomorrow night ?,neutral
139752,It's Friday . We should go party .,neutral
139754,Okay . Stay home Sunday . But Friday we should go out dancing .,neutral
139755,Do you feel like dancing ?,neutral
139770,"Yes . You have to teach me the samba , and the tango , and whatever else they do .",neutral
139772,Maybe .,neutral
139773,Nick ! How ’ s it going ?,neutral
139778,"Yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . You know , I'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion .",neutral
139780,"You know what , this is really embarrassing , but your name has just slipped my mind . Can you remind me ?",neutral
139781,"Sure , my name is Ana Ferris . Don ’ t worry about it . it happens to me all the time . I ’ m terrible with names too .",neutral
139787,Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school .,neutral
139790,Hmm . That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . Don't they ever relax ?,neutral
139791,"Of course they do.You know , Eliza , before I went over there I thought the same thing . I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much.But now that I've worked there , and taught them , I feel it is a good thing.Their parents are very concerned about their education . More than American parents are . And that is good . American kids don't study enough .",neutral
139795,"As an English teacher , I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . I tried to have a good time with my classes . The students often enjoyed it.And if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . So it was a good experience .",neutral
139798,Hmm . I know you taught in Costa Rica also.Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan ?,neutral
139802,I've heard about Enrail passes.So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot .,neutral
139805,I agree . And probably the automobile companies are too powerful.They never allowed the government to develop trains .,neutral
139811,Maybe you're right . They will have to develop alternative transportation.But it will be hard in America . Too many people are used to cars.Even in our movies cars are very important .,neutral
139813,Do you want me to give you a ride ?,neutral
139818,Maybe it's just a blessing in disguise . I've been wanting to try a new place anyway .,neutral
139829,There has been talk at school about canceling the concert .,neutral
139832,Does it bother you that your husband goes away on long business trips ?,neutral
139833,No.The time we have spent apart has been good for us.Absence makes the heart grow fonder .,neutral
139841,"I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities .",neutral
139849,It would be very hard work . Are you sure ?,neutral
139851,Running a farm would be totally different to you current job .,neutral
139860,What about restaurants and entertainment ?,neutral
139866,Is your city a historical place ?,neutral
139870,"As the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby .",neutral
139878,"I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up .",neutral
139880,I think there must be .,neutral
139888,"There's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon .",neutral
139892,"it's not about pay raise or promotion . You know , I hate getting up early in the morning and coming back home late at night .",neutral
139906,"Yes . but the husband had to work overtime three times a week , so he was always tired .",neutral
139910,"Yes , but not two every night . Anyway , the strain was too much for him . He had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital .",neutral
139916,Somewhere new . It's a great place to pick up chicks .,neutral
139917,"Need a new . girlfriend , huh ?",neutral
139924,"Oh , oh , that tears it ! I'm getting out of here .",neutral
139934,I've fallen in love with my boss .,neutral
139937,then what's your problem ?,neutral
139941,office romance is very tricky .,neutral
139946,I don't feel like drinking tonight . I'm gonna hang out at YY's .,neutral
139947,"YY's ? That place is boring . How about Xara's ? It's real classy , and they keep the place spin and span .",neutral
139948,"Yeah , but it's expensive . Nah , I'm going to YY's .",neutral
139951,"Wow , they really went to town on this place !",neutral
139965,how's it going ?,neutral
139969,there's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around .,neutral
139986,"almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive .",neutral
139988,"yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet .",neutral
139994,"how are you doing , Christopher ?",neutral
139996,are you doing anything this weekend ?,neutral
140001,that'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ?,neutral
140003,what should I bring with me ?,neutral
140007,I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ?,neutral
140010,"you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money .",neutral
140013,have you ever been to Disneyworld ?,neutral
140014,"when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ?",neutral
140017,"well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon .",neutral
140021,thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?,neutral
140027,thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight .,neutral
140029,Jack and Mary broke up .,neutral
140030,it ’ s so sad . They had been together for only two months . Do you know what the matter was ?,neutral
140049,do you have a car ?,neutral
140052,you could try . It would save you a lot of money .,neutral
140053,"that's true . Every month , I spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs .",neutral
140056,let's go to a car dealership . I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price .,neutral
140060,"yes , I mean it .",neutral
140062,"no , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working .",neutral
140066,I ’ m sorry .,neutral
140068,then why didn ’ t you talk to me ?,neutral
140073,shall we keep Our friendship ?,neutral
140074,"sure , let ’ s just be friends .",neutral
140085,yeah . We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners .,neutral
140086,definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce .,neutral
140088,that's true.Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon .,neutral
140089,what are you listening to ? Is that Beethoven or Mozart ?,neutral
140095,"to be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me .",neutral
140100,"how long have you been in to pop music , then ?",neutral
140114,who else is going to be there ?,neutral
140118,what time is it going to start ?,neutral
140130,just over three weeks . Would you like a drink ?,neutral
140131,"sure , what do you have ?",neutral
140135,so how many people are coming for the dinner tonight ?,neutral

140171,what do you think would make you happier ?,neutral
140172,"in the long run , I think breaking up with him would make me much happier , but I know that I'll be depressed about it for a few weeks first .",neutral
140173,relationships can be confusing sometimes .,neutral
140174,what would you do if you were me ?,neutral
140185,that'd be great . What kind of camera do you have ?,neutral
140191,"yes , I was planning on going . Are you ?",neutral

140198,I didn't know you were scared of heights ! Was it really bad ?,neutral
140200,so what did you do about it yesterday ?,neutral
140206,so have you cured your fear of heights ?,neutral
140207,"I think so . After I jumped out of the plane , I realized that I should just enjoy life . Worrying about it or not doing things out of fear is just plain silly .",neutral
140213,it sounds like you just need to be more careful .,neutral
140228,I'll let you know . Did you want to watch some TV ?,neutral
140236,"I swear , the overhead compartments on these planes just keep getting smaller and smaller !",neutral

140303,"I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails .",neutral
140314,You can ! With a little practice .,neutral
140318,Exercised over and over . Exercise is a key .,neutral

140328,"This is no laughing matter , Nick .",neutral

140389,and check whether they accept credit cards .,neutral
140395,you're a good student . I'm sure you can do well . What you need to do is to relax .,neutral
140410,"well , my friends and I are planning on going to Shangri-La on Saturday . Do you want to come with us ?",neutral
140414,"there is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes .",neutral
140426,"we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning .",neutral
140439,"yeah , I think so .",neutral
140443,not much . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .,neutral
140456,good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ?,neutral
140457,"I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour .",neutral
140459,I believe most of them think of it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known .,neutral
140468,and then ?,neutral
140473,"without traffic , it takes about an hour .",neutral
140475,"yes , I think so . It doesn ’ t close until 5 o ’ clock . You still have plenty of time .",neutral
140480,is she American ?,neutral
140482,"so I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ?",neutral

140504,"yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful .",neutral
140507,"yeah , that's nice .",neutral
140511,I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble .,neutral
140512,who are you writing a letter to ?,neutral
140513,I'm just responding to Sue's letter . Do you want to help ?,neutral
140516,"well , maybe you could tell them about my promotion .",neutral

140638,let's get started with this game then .,neutral
140643,"if I get the promotion , I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer .",neutral
140645,"whenever you are given added responsibilities , you should get a promotion .",neutral
140646,that makes sense . Who interviewed you ?,neutral
140651,I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally .,neutral
140652,those are good answers . How did she react ?,neutral
140653,"she told me that even when I become a senior engineer , I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team .",neutral
140655,she's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .,neutral
140667,"that's quite a bit . If I give you a raise , I'm going to have to give everyone a raise .",neutral
140704,"if that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?",neutral
140708,oh .,neutral
140710,sure .,neutral

156603,"Well , doctor ?",neutral
156608,"Well done , Fred . Do you know something useful for our promotion for our I-series ?",neutral
156609,"OK , Let me see . I suppose we must strengthen our promotion , because our brand is still new to some consumers . Maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously , because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places . Besides , the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products .",neutral
156610,That is a good idea to start with . I also think the mass media is also a good approach for advertising .,neutral
156611,"Yes , the mass media has wider influence . One of my classmates works in an advertisement company . I can get help and inspiration from him . And we can also try some less expensive approaches of advertising , such as on-line sales . Personally , I prefer to the on-line sales , for it is cheaper , faster and wider .",neutral

156953,"Stephen , can you work overtime tonight ?",neutral
156959,Did he say why ?,neutral
156968,"Just a moment . I'll tell you about that in a minute . Where was I ? Oh yes .

157505,"Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ?",neutral
157506,"To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help .",neutral

157630,It is known that there is a time limit for trademarks . And we should not have a similar trademark with the one in the same field .,neutral
157634,Some relative documents will be needed and the fee may be quite dear . So you need to learn more about the process and regulations about this issue .,neutral
157636,I am reading the book on patent and I think it will be helpful for my work,neutral
157638,Yep ! I heard that your company is registering a new trademark .,neutral

158215,"Yes , most of them . We trained on a dummy system last month . A couple of people were away so we've organised two more training sessions on the live system for the whole team this week .",neutral
158217,How long will the system be down for ?,neutral
158231,"I am working in a small company where further promotion is impossible , so I decided to change my job . I'd like to find a job which is more challenging .",neutral
158234,When was it serviced ?,neutral
158235,Just a couple of weeks ago . It's usually very reliable .,neutral

158304,And what's the maximum output ?,neutral
158307,Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually .,neutral
158315,"Yes , it is . But we need to take out more water . So it then passes through a series of rollers , where more water is squeezed out . After that it goes through the dryers , which are at a very high temperature . The paper is then coated . And finally it's wound onto reels and cut down into smaller lengths .",neutral
158316,How do you dispose of the waste in your factory ?,neutral
158318,What about the rest ? How do you get rid of it ?,neutral
158320,But doesn't incineration produce carbon monoxide ?,neutral

158446,Your hand is bleeding . What have you done to it ?,neutral
158449,What sort of problems do you have with these machines ?,neutral
158450,"They're quite complex machines and they have a lot of different components . We need to check the metal casing regularly for any signs of corrosion . We also check the brushes once a fortnight to make sure they aren't worn down . It's important to make sure everything is properly aligned and we adjust it if necessary . There is a canvas belt at the end of the assembly line . If it gets wet , it might rot so we check that regularly too .",neutral
158457,What do you recycle in your plant ?,neutral
158469,"Can I take a message , Mr Laing ?",neutral

158526,There have been too many unplanned shutdowns over the past few months . We'll have to make a few changes to the way we operate . We need to reduce our downtime .,neutral
158527,"I agree , but the maintenance team is fully stretched dealing with problems . We don't have time to carry out any preventive maintenance .",neutral
158529,How often do you service the pump ?,neutral
158532,"Well , from experience we can predict the lifespan of different components . We try to replace components before they fail or wear out . This prevents the equipment from breaking down . It also saves us a lot of trouble !",neutral
158536,"I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement .",neutral
158551,"Yes , that's right . I like this city very much and would like to make my home here .",neutral
158561,Do you know what you will be doing yet ?,neutral
158565,"You don't need to introduce yourself , Yang . You're famous .",neutral

158586,"Thanks , they are rather attractive . But I think there is nothing better than seeing things In actual operation .",neutral
158597,"Your products may have certain advantages , but your prices are too stiff .",neutral
158602,Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 .,neutral
158606,Good luck to us .,neutral
158609,The working hours are from 9:00 to 11:30 in the morning and from 1:30 to 5:30 in the afternoon . Make sure never to be late or absent . Every time you should use the employee card to show you are present whenever you come into the company .,neutral
158619,"For most of the articles in the catalog , we have good supply .",neutral

158629,"Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side .",neutral
158635,So are we . Our counter-offer is in line with the world market .,neutral

158643,"I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .",neutral
158652,We spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . We won't sacrifice quality for quick profits .,neutral
158653,"Well , we're really interested in placing an order under negotiation . We can start the negotiations as soon as you want .",neutral
158655,"Fine . As well , would you mind if I asked to see the Loyd's surveyor report of your products ? I may have a few more questions about your quality analysis .",neutral
158658,But a quality inspection system does not mean that each unit will always be up to the standard .,neutral
158659,We have trained analyzers to do quality analysis at the end of each part when we make the product . This means that no mistakes are made .,neutral
158661,"Certainly . We provide quality analysis training as part of the training for all new workers , plus a week of further training every year .",neutral
158664,Don't act like this . Please have good thoughts in your mind . What's behind you ?,neutral
158687,"OK , you ’ ll need to reboot your machine . Press Control , Alt and Delete at the same time .",neutral
158693,That's why you can't open it . You'll have to upgrade before you can read the file .,neutral
158697,"Yes , it is . As you know , some of the materials we use are highly-flammable so we have a very strict non-smoking policy in the factory .",neutral
158699,"It means there must be no naked flames or sparks anywhere near flammable materials . If the materials ignite , it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them .",neutral
158701,Have you checked your connection settings ?,neutral
158705,"Yes , of course . When you hear the fire alarm , which is a very loud , continuous ringing noise , you should go to the nearest fire exit or fire escape as quickly as possible .",neutral
158710,Should I try to put the fire out ?,neutral
158713,"I'd like to have rest , but I have many things to do .",neutral
158714,How about this post-trip ?,neutral
158730,I did clerical stuff and ran errands .,neutral
158731,"In this office , we encourage full attendance by offering a bonus . If you take any leaves , we'll deduct money from your salary .",neutral
158735,"We'll give you about 3000 to start . There'll be a trial period of three month . After six months , we'll have a job performance review and consider giving you a raise .",neutral

But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .",neutral
165187,What is your most preferred training method ?,neutral
165188,"Well , I prefer active rather than passive training . For example , I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues .",neutral

165205,How do you think a manager should react to an employee ’ s unsatisfactory work ?,neutral
165210,"Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other .",neutral

165225,Thanks . I had learned so much from you and our colleagues .,neutral

165235,"Yes , there is . See you then .",neutral
165246,You must be very busy these days . I heard you are responsible for the meeting arrangements this time . It can be the most important meeting for our company this year .,neutral
165252,I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator .,neutral
165258,"Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution .",neutral
165283,"Which job do you prefer , an accountant or a secretary ?",neutral
165284,"Neither , I prefer an active job .",neutral
165285,Then how about a salesman ?,neutral

173352,Could you give me some details about that ?,neutral

67164,"Then the little tailor stepped boldly forth and said, ""The princess has a silver and a golden hair on her head, and those are the two different colors.""",joy
67182,"When the bear heard the music, he could not help beginning to dance, and when he had danced a while, the thing pleased him so well that he said to the little tailor, ""Hark you, is the fiddle heavy?""",joy
67242,"Quick, quick, help me out of my prison; if thou pushest back the bolt of this glass coffin, then I shall be free.""",joy
67244,"Then she seated herself on a stone, ordered the young man to come to her, and after she had imprinted a friendly kiss on his lips, she said, ""My long-desired deliverer, kind Heaven has guided thee to me, and put an end to my sorrows.",joy
67301,"The third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him so well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever in the craft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow, and said, ""Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.""",joy
67305,"Not knowing what better to do, he came into the plan, and learnt tailoring from the beginning; and when he left his master, he gave him a needle, and said, ""You can sew anything with this, be it as soft as an egg or as hard as steel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.""",joy
67328,"So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these, and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then reached the ship and got home safe.",joy
67336,"And the king then gave to each half a kingdom, as he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and took good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the young lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have her again.",joy
67339,"Then he wanted to go his way; but she took hold of him, and said, ""Listen, my friend, to what I am going to tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after a little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds sitting on a cloak.",joy
67341,"Cut open the dead bird, take out its heart and keep it, and you will find a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise.",joy
67343,"The huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, ""If all this does happen, it will be a fine thing for me.""",joy
67358,"So the lady stole it away, and he never found any more gold under his pillow, for it lay now under the young lady""s, and the old woman took it away every morning; but he was so much in love that he never missed his prize.",joy
67392,Then the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they might know him.,joy
67420,"Come in and rest and let me give you something to eat and drink.""",joy
67453,"So they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out the bread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them, were still unconsumed.",joy
67502,"Then the king said, ""You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for your wife.""",joy
67547,I brought you there because I really loved you.,joy
67576,"""Then as you have spoken to me kindly, and are wise enough to seek for advice, I will tell you how and where to go.",joy
67582,"Further on he came to a room where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him joyfully, and said, if he would set her free from the spell that bound her, the kingdom should be his, if he would come back in a year and marry her.",joy
67611,"""He is still alive,"" said the huntsman; ""and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him go in peace, and brought home his royal coat.""",joy
67621,"So he journeyed on, thinking of her all the way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was made of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the gate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with joy, and said he was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the kingdom.",joy
67622,"When the first joy at their meeting was over, the princess told him she had heard of his father having forgiven him, and of his wish to have him home again: so, before his wedding with the princess, he went to visit his father, taking her with him.",joy
67626,"And young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once on the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the sugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak.",joy
67643,"He was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered fine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led to the outer chamber.",joy
67857,"""Very well indeed,"" answered he; ""one night is past, the two others will pass likewise.""",joy
67934,"Ah! now I know what it is to shudder!""",joy
67941,"""What a wonderful thing!"" said the king; ""I have seen many strange things, but such a monster as this I never saw.",joy
67955,"When the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow, who was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went.",joy
67960,"Here I discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws that control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the healing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of precious stones.",joy
67963,"Then the other answered, as if very unwillingly, ""A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou wilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an hour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown to me.""",joy
67968,"""How is it with thee, friend?"" said he, ""dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee?",joy
68028,"""Kate!",joy
68078,"So she took her time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried out, ""There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as carefully as you please.""",joy
68092,"So when Frederick and Catherine came down, there they found all their money safe and sound.",joy
68129,"""Yes,"" said Hans.",joy
68178,"When it was open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried away.",joy
68250,"Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it was not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that snorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind them followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and their swords flashed in the sun.",joy
68258,"All that he asked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse.",joy
68273,"The king""s daughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none of them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away.",joy
68275,"Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and he did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it.",joy
68291,"""My father is a mighty king, and gold have I in plenty as great as I require.""",joy
68310,"This pleased the Lord, and he went in.",joy
68315,"""With all my heart,"" he answered, ""I will go and offer it to him;"" and he went to the stranger and invited him, if he had no objection, to sleep in their bed and rest his limbs properly.",joy
68320,"Then the man said, ""What else should I wish for but eternal happiness, and that we two, as long as we live, may be healthy and have every day our daily bread; for the third wish, I do not know what to have.""",joy
68364,"So he got nothing by it but vexation, trouble, abuse, and the loss of his horse; but the poor people lived happily, quietly, and piously until their happy death.",joy
68382,"The next morning she asked the way she was to go, and took leave of her father, and went forth with a bold heart into the wood.",joy
68390,"But she told them how happy she was, and stayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood.",joy
68426,"But as she sat she bethought herself of the egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it, there ran out a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold, that played about, and then nestled under the old one""s wings, so as to form the most beautiful sight in the world.",joy
68569,"There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that, was quite happy and thought: ""You certainly are a pretty girl!""",joy
68591,"So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the one chicken in great glee.",joy
68700,"However, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, ""I will help you; lie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be dead.""",joy

68904,"""Good evening, Hans.",joy
68979,"At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about his son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than before.",joy

69122,"The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth heard no more; they had disappeared, and the country was freed from the trouble.",joy
69159,"He rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it.",joy
69185,"He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented.",joy
69201,"He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came to the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where the merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not withstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and his country in the same manner.",joy
69204,"But he was thankful to the fox, and did not attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, ""Sit upon my tail, and you will travel faster.""",joy
69241,"""Well,"" thought the young man, ""it is no hard matter to keep that advice.""",joy
69251,"Then he went to the king, and told him all his brothers"" roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the princess given to him again; and after the king""s death he was heir to his kingdom.",joy
69293,"The princess sprang up, threw her arms round his neck, embraced and kissed him repeatedly, and took her stomacher, which was made of pure gold, and hung it round his neck.",joy
69323,"He found the blue light, and made her a signal to draw him up again.",joy
69336,"When he was above, he said to the little man: ""Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before the judge.""",joy
69377,"""Go wheresoever they take you, and let them do what they will, only take the blue light with you.""",joy

69475,"The servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him the best place in the court that he could wish for.",joy
69478,"They leapt with delight, put out their heads, and cried to him: ""We will remember you and repay you for saving us!""",joy
69510,"The mother, however, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own daughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made to do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the family.",joy
69519,Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a heap and walked on again.,joy
69524,"The old woman spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter into her service.",joy
69539,"She related to them all that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her great riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go and try her fortune.",joy
69547,"At last she came to Mother Holle""s house, and as she had heard all about the large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged herself without delay to the old woman.",joy
69640,"Still, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to be a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about.",joy
69703,"Tom, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would not dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called out, ""My good friend, I can show you a famous treat.""",joy
69714,"Tom heard all this, and cried out, ""Father, father!",joy
69722,"""Well,"" said they, ""you are come back, and we will not sell you again for all the riches in the world.""",joy
69764,"When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train before the king""s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people running on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite loudly, and as if she would never stop.",joy
69844,"But Red-Cap went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm her again.",joy

70333,I have much the best of the bargain.,joy

70637,"I have saved up my three years"" earnings and have it all safe in my pocket.""",joy
70641,"Then the countryman rejoiced at his good luck, and said, ""I like many things better than money: first, I will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly, a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.""",joy

120854,"I know life is not all roses , and I believe I will pull this through .",joy
120868,"Not really , but I liked the design , so I got it .",joy
120869,Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better .,joy
120881,Yes.Do you like it ?,joy
120896,Peak periods always entail hours of queuing . At least you got a nice tan though !,joy
120898,My friends and I just got back from Bali .,joy

121568,"Fine , what do you call this ?",joy
121576,Let me see . We can visit the country . We haven't done that for such a long time .,joy
121587,"It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say .",joy
121590,I quite agree with you.See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry !,joy
121593,You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon .,joy
121596,"Oh , my shoes pinch me . Let's find a seat and sit a while .",joy
121621,OK . I have a good pair of hiking boots . It should not be a big problem .,joy
121641,"All kinds , but mostly Pop , rock and classical . Why ?",joy
121648,"Yes , that's a good idea .",joy
121650,"Oh , I think I know the place you mean . We ate there last month , right ?",joy

121661,"Well , he's very tall and handsome .",joy
121719,I guess I asked the wrong person .,joy
121734,Yes .,joy
121738,That would be great .,joy

121966,"Yeah , why not ? I've got a little free time on my hands . Where do you want to eat ?",joy
121972,"Yes , I think I am . Let's meet for lunch at mouth restaurant .",joy
121974,That's fine . See you there !,joy
121976,"Fortunately , there is no person died .",joy
121977,That's great . It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake .,joy
121982,"Yeah , we've experienced the 8.0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchman .",joy
121984,"Right . But people at that time only know two words , "" save "" and "" assistance "" , they will never don't lift a finger . Life is the most important compared with anything else .",joy
121986,What a pin-up she is !,joy
122043,That's interesting . How often do you write a blog ?,joy
122052,"Pretty good , thanks . I'm going to see my uncle .",joy
122072,"It was great . The director took a lot of care while framing . They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director . Also I like the actors , some really great new young actors .",joy
122078,It would be a really good choice . The movie is very suitable for lovers to see together . I'm sure you won't regret it .,joy
122106,I'd love something spicy . Maybe we could get some Sichuan hotpot .,joy
122138,"Nice to meet you , too .",joy

122208,"Yes , Steven . You always know what I want .",joy
122210,Thank you !,joy
122222,How about seven ?,joy
122227,Sure . You've given a great help to me in the past days .,joy
122229,Certainly . I'll be glad to .,joy
122236,That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ?,joy
122239,"I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy .",joy
122241,"The Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food .",joy
122243,Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?,joy
122248,"No , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time .",joy
122249,I won't argue with that ! Let's go !,joy

122534,"Oh , congratulations !",joy
122542,Thank you !,joy
122563,Thank you . I will if I have chance.Goodbye and happy landing !,joy
122575,That ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work .,joy
122577,I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing !,joy
122598,Of course not . You can come to London to visit me in future . And I also will come here if I have a chance .,joy
122599,I will miss you .,joy

123303,Couldn't be better .,joy
123384,I enjoy camping .,joy
123416,You must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun .,joy
123452,"Yeah , I will be there .",joy
123462,Wonderful . Just e-mail me the time and date and I'll be there .,joy
123466,That sounds like a great idea !,joy

123961,Sounds a good weekend . You know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and Jo can become such close friends .,joy
123962,"Yeah , I never thought we could be good friends either . We have our differences . She's more outgoing and active while I am more quiet and reversed , but we still get along extremely well . We can talk for hours about anything .",joy

124509,"En , it's so beautiful that I don't want to move my eyes from it .",joy
124511,"The same to me . All the things here make me happy , the mountain , the water , the grass , the birds , the sunshine ...",joy
124512,I think we should go out more frequently . The natural scenery can do us good .,joy
124532,Do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city ?,joy
124535,"Hi Amy , you look very happy .",joy
124545,You look great . Your make-up is perfect .,joy

124648,"Just think , in a few days , I'll be swimming and lying in the sun and just taking it easy .",joy
124650,You'll see the world-famous magnificent waterfall .,joy
124651,I like the sight and the sound . It worked on me like a magic when I was a child,joy
124658,"Yes , I enjoyed it very much .",joy
124660,"Let me see . Ah , yes , I've been to England , France , Germany , Italy and now I've been in Spain",joy
